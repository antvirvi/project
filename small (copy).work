Q contraceptive implants offer immense potential to meet the need for family planning more than 220 million women in developing countries currently have an unmet need for modern contraception mainly in south asia and sub saharan africa _1 many other women are using less effective resupply methods short acting methods that require users to continually replenish their supplies of the contraceptive because highly effective more convenient methods such as implants are not easily accessible in all countries access is lower among poorer less educated rural and younger women _1 2 from january 1 2009 to december 31 2012 more than 9 million implants valued at over us $190 million have been shipped to developing countries 87 to sub saharan africa _3 the magnitude of commodity provision is likely to increase markedly due to major price reductions what are implants why do they offer so much promise what challenges must programs address to make them even more widely accessible and used the promise of implants what women like about implants implants are a long acting reversible form of progestin only contraception that release an ultra low amount of progestin continuously into the bloodstream currently 3 implants are available implanon _ jadelle _ and sino implant ii _ see table women who use implants find them to be very convenient they are effective immediately and offer up to 3 to 5 years of extremely reliable contraceptive protection upon one client action only a brief very minor surgical procedure under local anesthesia is needed to place 1 or 2 matchstick sized plastic rods beneath the skin of the inner upper arm _4 5 some women also like that pelvic exams and laboratory tests are not required and that implants can be used discreetly furthermore implants do not interfere with sexual intercourse and return to fertility upon removal is not delayed or negatively affected table key characteristics of the 3 available contraceptive implants implanon jadelle sino implant ii

of implanon may be lowered in the future to be comparable with that of jadelle source modified from a table prepared by fhi 360 the respond project and usaid unmatched effectiveness effectiveness is a key feature for women and couples using contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy but in our experience even family planning professionals do not always fully realize just how effective implants are only 1 unintended pregnancy occurs among every 2 000 implant users in the first year of use _6 in contrast failure rates in the first year of typical use of the commonly used resupply methods are considerably higher 180 unintended pregnancies per 1 000 users of male condoms 90 unintended pregnancies per 1 000 users of pills and 60 unintended pregnancies per 1 000 users of the progestin only injectable depo provera_ _6 thus implants are 120 times more effective than the injectable 180 times more effective than the pill and 360 times more effective than the condom suitable for all reproductive intentions and nearly all women implants are an excellent choice to achieve any reproductive intention to delay a first pregnancy space a subsequent birth or end childbearing according to the world health organization s who s medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use _7 and family planning a global handbook for providers _4 implants are safe and suitable for nearly all women including women who are of any age including adolescents have never been pregnant or have never had children are living with hiv have just had an abortion or are breastfeeding implants are safe and suitable for nearly all women with only one action women who use implants can be almost certain not to have an unintended pregnancy for up to 3 to 5 years implants are over 100 times more effective than injectables and pills in typical use and 360 times more effective than condoms recommendations among normative bodies differ about the suitability of implants use by breastfeeding women during the first 6 weeks after childbirth however who guidance states that the risks outweigh benefits during this period _7 the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc advises that the benefits outweigh risks during the first 4 weeks and places no restrictions on use after 4 weeks _8 the u k s royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists places no restrictions on use of implants by breastfeeding women at any time _9 immediate postpartum provision of implants would offer expanded programmatic opportunity as women are increasingly receiving safe delivery services and there is almost universal interest among postpartum women in avoiding a pregnancy for at least 2 years _10 implants also offer great promise for helping to meet the needs of younger women who often face many barriers in accessing effective modern contraception when implants were made available to young kenyan women ages 18 24 seeking family planning 24 selected the method _11 the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends that providers encourage adolescents ages 15 19 seeking contraception to consider implants and intrauterine devices iuds as the best reversible methods for preventing unintended pregnancy rapid repeat pregnancy and abortion in young women _12 rising popularity although modern contraceptive use lags in sub saharan africa where only 1 in 6 married women uses it contraceptive use has recently increased substantially in a number of eastern and southern african countries _13 while this has been mainly due to increased use of injectables implants use has also increased notably over a short time span in countries such as ethiopia malawi rwanda and tanzania see box and figure for example 1 in every 7 women using modern contraception in rwanda currently relies on an implant compared with less than 1 in 25 in 2005. _14 these trends suggest that wider availability of implants could lead to much greater use in other african countries and elsewhere where implants currently cannot be accessed widely or easily high rates of user satisfaction 79 and continuation around 84 at 1 year of use further support this likelihood _6 _ _17 figure increased use of implants in malawi tanzania ethiopia and rwanda 2004 2011_a _a all data are for currently married women ages 15 49 _b the 2005 rwanda survey grouped use of implants with other modern methods data from the demographic and health surveys _14 box implants use on the upswing in eastern and southern african countries ethiopia malawi rwanda and tanzania have recently achieved notable increases in their modern method contraceptive prevalence rates cpr including for implants as seen in the figure in only 5 to 6 years implants use doubled in malawi quadrupled in tanzania and rose more than 15 fold in rwanda and 17 fold in ethiopia _14 implants have become the second most popular method in ethiopia and the third most popular method in rwanda one of every 7 married women using modern contraception in rwanda and 1 in every 8 in ethiopia relies on an implant for her contraceptive protection the cpr for implants in rwanda is 6.3 among currently married women 5.9 among sexually active unmarried women and 6.4 among rural women these are the highest rates in sub saharan africa and among the highest in the world what accounts for this success among the most important factors have been an enabling environment with strong policy commitment from the highest levels downward as manifested most recently by the prime ministers of ethiopia and rwanda at the london summit _15 and supportive service policies that encourage task sharing and task shifting on the supply side training to ensure widespread insertion and removal skills and substantial donor support for purchase of commodities 3.7 million implants valued at us $72 million were purchased for these 4 african countries between 2009 and 2012 _16 and on the demand side a marked rise in implants knowledge stimulated by communication activities in programs as well as by diffusion of knowledge among women themselves in ethiopia knowledge of implants among married women ages 15 49 increased to 69 in 2011 from only 20 in 2005 and knowledge was even higher among sexually active unmarried women 82 _14 in rwanda where only half of married women knew of implants in 2005 such knowledge became universal 97 by 2010. _14 increasingly affordable and available prospects for increased availability and use were greatly enhanced when bayer healthcare recently announced that it would cut the public sector price of its contraceptive implant jadelle in half as a result of volume guarantees from international donor partners _18 beginning in january 2013 jadelle will cost us $8.50 per set the partnership initiative aims to make 27 million implants available to the public sector and non commercial private sector in up to 69 low income countries from 2013 to 2018 this is likely to be a signal milestone on the long road toward wider use of implants the commodity cost of implants once as high as us $23.80 per set has been a major impediment to their wider availability in comparison the public sector commodity cost of a copper t iud ranges from us $0.36 to $0.48. _1 having 3 implants in the market appears to have helped induce these lower commodity prices and hopefully prices will continue to fall what programs can do ensure a client centered approach a knowledgeable empowered client is central to the provision and receipt of quality family planning services _19 this entails that programs
 provide and ensure informed choice from among a wide range of contraceptive options this has long been the bedrock principle of organized family planning programs thoughtful counseling to help clients select a method discuss its characteristics and dispel myths and misconceptions for example that implants might migrate within the body counseling should also make clear that clients do not need to use an implant for its full length of labeled use in order to receive it anticipatory guidance regarding common side effects of implants especially about bleeding disturbances and their acceptability to the client within her sociocultural context this is particularly important as changes in menstrual patterns irregular infrequent or no bleeding while not harmful are expected _20 the specific pattern in any given woman cannot be predicted with certainty however capable and reassuring management of side effects especially of bleeding changes is thus often the difference between satisfaction and discontinuation side effects and health concerns are the main reason why women discontinue hormonal methods _21 and bleeding unpredictability is a chief reason why they discontinue implants _20 regular and reliable access to prompt removal services adequate follow up including making it clear that although the client does not need to return she can and should return at any time whether for advice reassurance treatment of side effects or removal counseling about and management of bleeding side effects are key to helping women use implants successfully appreciate and nurture providers in addition to focusing on the client programs must be attentive to the perspectives needs and workloads of providers _22 23 without adequate availability and distribution of skilled motivated and enabled providers there can be little provision of implants _24 in other words no provider no program fortunately for resource constrained programs many categories of health care providers not only doctors but also nurses midwives auxiliary nurses auxiliary nurse midwives and clinical officers are capable once trained of safely providing implants _25 such task shifting or task sharing among health cadres is an accepted policy and programmatic reality _25 26 ethiopia has even launched a program to train and enable 15 000 rural community health extension workers chews to insert implanon _27 whose one rod can be inserted easily in 1 to 2 minutes removals are handled by referral to higher level cadres many cadres of health care providers can provide implants safely and effectively ensure access to removal services programs also need to ensure routine regular and reliable removal services for clients beginning by planning for them at the outset of service expansion efforts failure to provide reliable and ready access to removal services could easily tarnish the method s image and undermine an entire family planning program consider use of dedicated providers and mobile services a number of countries have successfully followed innovative public private service delivery models that entail the use of dedicated providers these providers focus primarily on delivering underutilized clinical contraceptive methods including implants a wider range of method choices is generally available at the service site the service models have also typically entailed task shifting and provision of free services either in static public sector service sites or through mobile outreach in zambia 18 retired midwives were placed at high volume public sector facilities solely to provide long acting and reversible contraceptives larcs these dedicated providers inserted more than 22 000 implants and 11 000 iuds in 14 months and reached younger and lower parity women _28 in tanzania a policy shift allowed nurses as well as physicians to provide implants subsequently insertions more than doubled from around 10 000 per quarter in 2007 to more than 20 000 per quarter in 2009 _29 and nurses became the main providers of implants in malawi where use of dedicated non physician providers and mobile services contributed substantially to wide use of female sterilization prevalence of 10 among married women in 2010 _30 implants provision through the same service modalities and providers also rose see box other program and health system considerations the following programmatic subsystems must be in place and functional to ensure that quality implant insertion and removal services can be regularly and reliably provided_19 _ _24 commodity logistics and supplies supervision and management infection prevention and quality control pre service and in service training for all cadres who provide implants health communication demand creation and marketing client follow up the environment also must be enabling and supportive with strong political commitment adequate and well deployed financial and human resources service delivery policies guidelines and standards that permit task shifting and task sharing to allow other skilled cadres besides doctors to provide implants no restrictions on access because of age parity marital status hiv status or socioeconomic status widespread gender equity innovative models utilizing dedicated non physician providers have increased availability and use of implants finally recurrent costs for infrastructure and staff must be met despite these costs the overall cost of implants per couple year of protection cyp is comparable to or less than that of injectables or oral contraceptives and cost effectiveness rises with longer use _31 33 the overall cost of implants per cyp is comparable to or less than that of injectables or pills what is at stake a woman in sub saharan africa faces a 1 in 39 lifetime risk of maternal death and a woman in south asia has a 1 in 150 lifetime risk _34 in contrast the lifetime risk of maternal death in industrialized countries is 1 in 4 700 nearly all maternal deaths 99 occur in low resource countries _35 and for every instance of maternal mortality 20 instances of serious morbidity such as obstetric fistula occur _36 risk of morbidity and mortality is higher among poorer women who have less access to modern contraception including implants access is also more constrained for young women among whom 44 of all unintended pregnancies in sub saharan africa occur _10 meeting unmet need for contraception could prevent more than 100 000 maternal deaths each year satisfying unmet need for contraception could reduce maternal mortality by 29 preventing more than 100 000 maternal deaths each year _34 if only 1 of 5 sub saharan african women now using pills or injectables that is other less effective hormonal contraception were to switch to an implant more than 1.8 million unintended pregnancies would be averted in 5 years resulting in almost 600 000 fewer abortions and 10 000 fewer maternal deaths _37 if even more women were to switch or if women not currently using contraception were to access and use implants even greater individual and public health would accrue meeting the need for effective modern contraception including much wider provision of contraceptive implants to women who would want them is not only a family planning and health issue it is a matter of social justice and an equity imperative our challenge the 2012 london summit on family planning attended by more than 150 leaders and representatives of governments and civil society endorsed an ambitious goal of providing family planning to an additional 120 million women _38 widespread provision of implants in a quality manner offers a substantial way to help achieve this goal if the global health community can rise to the challenge we must do it right and do it now

Q 1 introduction extracellular recording from hippocampal slices has long been a method of choice for determining the changes in excitability and synaptic plasticity of the ca1 microcircuitry 1 spontaneous spikes and far more often field excitatory postsynaptic potentials fepsps are recorded extracellularly from a local network of neurons however the relationship between these two phenomena is not fully clear intuitively both electrophysiological events correlate with the excitability of the network under investigation but these events are generated by different mechanisms field epsps are mainly composed of subthreshold events from a population of neurons like dendritic depolarizations 2 and glial contributions to the net extracellular charge flow arising mainly from the function of transporters 3 4 in contrast spontaneous firing represents only neuronal suprathreshold events 5 another difference is that a fepsp is evoked by a stimulus and therefore it is the result of a coordinated and synchronized electrical activity of a cell population mediated by synaptic connections spontaneous spikes in contrast are not evoked by an external stimulus and they are more likely to be dependent on intrinsic network connections and properties 6 n methyl d aspartate receptor nmdar and  amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid receptor ampar play a key role in generating rapid excitatory events in the ca1 but these receptors serve different purposes their relative contribution to fepsps is well described 7 however their involvement in spontaneous spike generation remains unknown and data on the correlation of extracellularly recorded field responses and action potentials are scarce activation of glutamate glu receptors is known to play an important role in the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity that might be the cellular basis of learning and memory 8 several studies have shown that the synaptic plasticity is impaired in alzheimer s disease ad 9 the most common form of neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of insoluble amyloid deposits in the brain overwhelming evidence suggests that the main component of plaques amyloid beta abeta peptide is thought to be responsible for the synaptic and cellular pathology of ad for review see 10 numerous studies have reported that the severity of ad strongly correlates with decreased synapse density in hippocampus and cortex and with disruption of memory related synapse function literature data strongly support the synaptotoxicity of abeta 1 42 and the accumulation of soluble abeta 1 42 11 in the brain of patients and animal models of ad is associated with impairments of cognition and memory 12 14 recently abeta 1 42 was shown to induce epileptiform activity both in vitro 15 and in vivo and transgenic mice overexpressing abeta develop seizures over time 16 moreover ad patients have an estimated 87 times higher probability of developing epileptic seizures compared to age matched population 17 despite the recent advancement in the research of the pathomechanisms of ad the exact mechanism by which neuronal overactivity develops is unknown recent findings suggest that abeta blocks neuronal glutamate glu uptake at synapses leading to increased glu level at the synaptic cleft 18 increased brain extracellular glu but not  aminobutyric acid gaba concentration was found upon abeta administration by use of microdialysis technique 19 20 a resultant rise in glu levels would lead to a spillover and activation of extra or perisynaptic nmdars enriched in the b isoform of the nmdar 2 subunit nr2b which play a major role in the induction of long term depression ltd 21 and have also been shown to help mediate the inhibition of long term potentiation ltp by soluble abeta oligomers 22 in this study we investigated the mechanisms by which fepsps and spontaneous firing are regulated in the ca1 of hippocampal slices we confirmed that fepsp but not spiking activity is mainly mediated by ampars in contrast spontaneous activity is regulated by nmdars bath application of synaptotoxic abeta 1 42 greatly enhanced spontaneous firing rate which could be prevented by blocking nr2b subunits 2 experimental procedures 2.1 compounds for the preparation of artificial cerebrospinal fluid acsf all salts glucose 6 cyano 7 nitroquinoxaline 2 3 dione cnqx mk 801 hydrogen

stimulation intensities for evoked responses were determined to evoke responses 30 of the maximal stimulation intensity was used the level of ltp the last 10 peak to peak amplitudes was compared to the average of the last 20 peak to peak amplitudes of evoked fepsps before applying theta burst stimulation tbs tbs comprised of 15 bursts given at 5 hz and individual burst contained 4 pulses given at 100 hz per burst 2.3.2 drug treatments all slices were incubated for 30 min without stimulation in the recording chamber before any recording was done following the first spike recording slices

during treatment evoked fepsps were recorded 2.4 synthesis and characterization of abeta 1 42 detailed description of the synthesis and characterization of abeta 1 42 is reported in 23 24 briefly a depsipeptide derivative of abeta 1 42 was synthesized and after purification it was used in lyophilized form a 200  m stock solution of the peptide was prepared in 0.1 mm naoh and the ph was set to 11.0 after incubation for 2 h at ambient temperature the stock solution was diluted into acsf to a concentration of 50  m and the ph was set to 7.3 the peptide solution was incubated for 12 h at 37 c and prior to use it was diluted with acsf to a final concentration of 1  m aggregation grade and the size distribution of the oligomers were checked by western blots by following the methods described in 23 oligomers were detected either with sequence specific bam10 antibody sigma aldrich or with conformation specific oc antibody millipore which detects the oligomers of fibrillar nature that is with beta sheet structure 2.5 statistics 2.5.1 statistical analysis for fepsps testing for normality was done with the kolmogorov smirnov normality test our data have shown normal distribution hence independent samples t test and one way repeated measures analysis of variance anova were used with the bonferroni test for post hoc analysis the p value 0.05 was considered significant in all cases

hyperexcitability caused by abeta 1 42 requires the activation of extrasynaptic nr2b receptors but not ampars 3.5 characterization of abeta 1 42 the size distribution of abeta 1 42 oligomers formed in 50  m after incubation at 37 c was studied on western blots by using two different antibodies the monoclonal bam10 antibody is sequence specific and binds to the n terminal end of the peptide while oc stains the oligomers of fibrillar nature protofibrils oligomers with beta sheet structure 26 supplementary figure 4 shows the results of the wb experiments bam10 staining reveals the presence of both low and high molecular weight oligomers in the sample while their positive staining with the oc antibody indicates that they have protofibrillar characteristics the presence of sds stable dimers and trimers in the sample closely resembles abeta 1 42 derived from biological sources namely from transfected 7pa2 cells 27 and from human brain 28 29 these species were shown to have strong synaptotoxic properties 30 on the other hand protofibrillar species which are also abundant in our sample were also reported to be synaptotoxic 16 4 discussion 4.1 ampa receptors regulate fepsps and nmda receptors mediate spontaneous spiking extracellular fepsp recordings are the gold standard for determining the excitation and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices the changes of spontaneous spiking activity under conditions that modify network excitability are however less well studied in acute slices in these sets of experiments we have studied the involvement of ampars and nmdars in fepsps evoked by schaffer stimulation and in spontaneous firing in the ca1 we show that these two electrophysiological markers previously thought to underlie measures of excitation are not correlated importantly the spikes we recorded here were almost exclusively localized to the pyramidal layer of ca1 hence they were presumably from principal cells multiunit activity recordings do not allow separating the firing from individual neurons and may include bursts of spikes fired by the same neuron thus in our study spiking represents the global amount of activity within this network and most probably the activity of principal cells the firing rates observed in this study were comparable to previously reported values in slices of ca1 of the guinea pig 0.22 and 1.8 spikes sec 6 under our conditions blocking ampar with cnqx inhibited fepsps however the spiking activity did not change in contrast modulating nmdar function affected spontaneous firing without any change in evoked fepsps blocking nmdars ablated while enhancing nmdar function increased spontaneous activity 4.2 possible involvement of the ca1 local microcircuitry in the regulation of spontaneous spiking direct comparison of data from ca3 spiking regulation and our ca1 data is difficult because glutamatergic pyramidal cells of the ca3 form massive recurrent loops a feature that is missing in the ca1 therefore the activity of ca1 pyramidal cells is regulated by the excitation arriving from ca3 through the schaffer collateral and by the inhibition of the local interneuron microcircuitry although the activity of ca1 inhibitory cells has been reported to be scarce compared to ca3 in acute slices powerful pyramidal somatic inhibition could be detected upon minimal electric stimulation 31 showing that the inhibition
 is very effective what is the driving force of the interneuronal activity one possible explanation is that the spontaneous activity of the incoming axons of the ca3 principal cells recruits a ca1 inhibitory microcircuitry via the schaffer collateral this is unlikely because there is no correlation between ca3 multiunit activity and the extracellularly recorded inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the ca1 31 another possibility is that the spontaneous discharge of ca1 interneurons although scarce is keeping a strong blockade of the principal cells favoring this hypothesis the resting membrane potential is more hyperpolarized in ca1 compared to ca3 pyramidal neurons 32 33 these spontaneous discharges might be regulated by the ambient glu concentration via nmdars indeed tonic activation of nmdars by ambient glutamate has been described in virtually all pyramidal cells of the ca1 of the hippocampus in slice models 34 37 importantly as le meur et al have shown 38 neither ampa kainate receptors nor metabotropic glutamate receptors contribute to this tonic excitation of pyramidal neurons this tonic current is not dependent on vesicular release of transmitters from neurons but is affected by inhibition of the enzyme converting glu in glutamine in glial cells indicating that ambient glu is mainly of glial origin consistent with these findings we have also shown that spontaneous spiking is driven by nmdar activity but not by ampars indicating that the tonic activation could reach the threshold of spike generation the question arises as follows why do not ampars mediate spontaneous activity nmdars have a much higher affinity for glu than ampars do in steady state conditions the ec50 for glu at nmdars is over two orders of magnitude lower than that at ampars 39 extrasynaptic nmdars containing the nr2b subunit have even higher affinity than synaptic nr2a containing receptors 40 it should be noted that evoked firing which is usually detected in the form of population spikes pop spikes for short in ca1 extracellular recordings is mediated by ampar signaling 41 under our conditions action potentials were not inhibited by ampar blockade the reason behind this discrepancy might be that evoked pop spikes require a synchronous discharge of a population of cells this coordinated function might be based on the fast ampar function 4.3 abeta 1 42 impairs ltp and hyperexcites without altering fepsps in the ca1 neuronal hyperexcitability in early ad and in ad modeling mice is an emerging finding that points to a network dysfunction as a critical component of the pathomechanism soluble abeta species have been increasingly implicated as the key pathologic components of the disease thus elucidating the mechanisms by which these species alter neuronal function is important we confirmed that the abeta 1 42 preparation we use is really synaptotoxic impairing ltp next we tested its effect on spontaneous firing and found that it enhanced the rate of spontaneous discharges but did not alter evoked fepsps these results suggest that nmdars are involved in the hyperexcitability induced by abeta 1 42 similar results have been recently reported by varghese et al using cultured embryonic rat hippocampal cells abeta increased spontaneous firing activity dose dependently reaching the maximum after 1 hour of treatment which was followed by a complete cessation of spikes following a few hours 42 the discrepancy between this and our result may be due to the fact that the authors have used a cell culture largely devoid of glial elements while we have used a complex microcircuitry built up from all of the neuronal cell types including glia forming elaborate connections the forms of nmdar are heterotetramer including two nr1 and two nr2 subunits 43 one particular subunit nr2b is mainly localized in extrasynaptic side abeta induced elevation of spiking activity could be prevented by blocking the nr2b subunits suggesting that abeta activates extrasynaptic nmdars the role of extrasynaptic or perisynaptic nmdars in abeta 1 42 induced changes in functional synaptic plasticity and subsequent cell death has received much attention recently 22 44 45 extrasynaptic nmdars contain predominantly nr2b subunits which in contrast to nr2a containing synaptic nmdars trigger apoptotic signaling cascade 46 recently it was shown using organotypic hippocampal cell cultures that abeta induces neuronal death and subsequent tau hyperphosporilation via extrasynaptic nr2b subunit 47 blocking nr2b subunits not only prevents hyperexcitation caused by abeta but also rescues abeta induced ltp impairment 22 48 suggesting that blocking nr2b subunits might be a promising target in ad however others have reported that abeta oligomers directly activate nmdars especially via nr2a subunit 49 50 5 conclusions taken together we show that two electrophysiological events recorded from hippocampal slices which evoked fepsps and spontaneous firing are not mediated by the same mechanisms evoked fepsps but not firing activity were mainly regulated by ampars in contrast spontaneous spikes are governed by nmdar function bath applications of synaptotoxic abeta 1 42 enhanced firing activity in an nr2b dependent manner without altering evoked fepsps these effects may contribute to synaptic dysfunctions seen in early ad 6 highlights spontaneous discharges and evoked fepsps were recorded from the ca1 of murine slices ampa receptor blockade ablates fepsps without any effect on spiking rate nmda receptor modulation affects spontaneous spiking but not evoked fepsps synaptotoxic amyloid beta leaves evoked fepsps unaltered but increases firing activity via nr2b these results confirm that amyloid beta induces hyperexcitation through nr2b activation supplementary material supplementary figure 1 cnqx abolished evoked fepsps even under condition that promotes nmdar activation in low mg_2 acsf supplementary

supplementary figure 3 small concentration of nmda 0.5  m which was reported to activate extrasynaptic nmdars did not affect fepsps supplementary figure 4 abeta 1 42 samples used for the recordings contained clearly detectable sds stable trimers 15 kda and higher molecular weight protofibrils staining with oc antibody which is specific for species having beta sheet conformation shows that the

Q introduction the purpose of prophylactic antibiotic use is to prevent local or systemic postprocedural infection two types of infection dominate urologic surgery 1 urinary tract infection uti which is either a space or organ infection associated with both endoscopic and endoluminal interventions and with both open or laparoscopic surgery mostly coinciding with catheter and stent placement or an undetected harbored bacterial load and 2 wound infection after open and laparoscopic surgery a third form of infection is observed in the male genital system prostatitis epididymitis and orchitis a fourth form of infection bloodstream borne sepsis secondary to urologic instrumentation accounts for 10 to 12 of healthcare associated infections in urology wards 1 however the use of antibiotics in urologic surgery has been controversial for decades 2 3 during the previous decade much progress in prostate surgery has been made e g transurethral surgery open and laparoscopic prostatectomy however controversy over antibiotic prophylaxis for prostatic surgery remains in the context of surgical field classification transurethral resection of the prostate turp can be categorized into a clean contaminated or contaminated operation depending on the patient s history of uti urogenital infection catheterization and sterile nonsterile urine 4 this classification may extend to total or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy because during surgery opening of the urogenital tract is inevitable and foley catheterization is mandatory after the procedure 5 in this regard the administration of prophylactic antibiotics is suitable for prevention of postoperative infectious complications unfortunately however studies of the prophylactic effect of antimicrobial therapy and risk factors associated with turp and other prostate interventions e g adenoma enucleation laser ablation have been limited 6 7 8 9 in addition there are few retrospective or prospective cohort studies of the prophylactic antibiotic effectiveness in total or radical prostatectomy 10 11 12 these studies focused only on surgical site infection not uti and did not include risk factor assessment as mentioned previously in cases of prostatectomy the urinary tract is opened during the procedure thus postoperative bacteriuria is probably the main source of postoperative infectious complications 13 therefore it is reasonable to identify the risk factors for postoperative bacteriuria or infectious complications and the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for prostate surgery there is currently a lack of information on the risk factors for infectious complications associated with prostate surgery in korea in addition the health insurance review assessment service of korea recently recommended the use of first or second generation instead of third generation cephalosporins for prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing prostate surgery without any korean evidence therefore we evaluated the risk factors for infectious complications after transurethral surgery of the prostate and after open or laparoscopic prostate surgery as well as the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis materials and methods study population from january 2012 to june 2013 we evaluated a total of 424 patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer who underwent turp holmium laser enucleation of the prostate photovaporization of the prostate greenlight laser american medical systems minnetonka mn usa or prostatectomy at multiple institutions in korea inclusion criteria were as follows patients who received initial intravenous antibiotics 30 to 60 min before prostate related surgery patients who underwent urinalysis and urine culture by collection of a midstream urine sample on 3 to 5 days preoperatively at 4 to 8 hr after postoperative removal of the catheter and 1 to 2 weeks postoperatively patients were ineligible if they had no follow up urinalysis and urine culture all data were recorded prospectively the clinical parameters subjected to analysis were age preoperative maximal flow rate residual urine volume prostate volume prostate specific antigen level resected prostate volume fresh tissue weight in the operating room operation time minutes duration of postoperative catheterization presence of bladder stones recent within 2 weeks or preoperative uti presence of preoperative foley catheterization duration of antibiotic therapy intravenous and oral presence of diabetes mellitus dm operation method type of antibiotics and infectious complication rate postoperative infectious complications were defined as febrile uti and bacteriuria defintion of postoperative infectious complications because postoperative bacteriuria is the best assessed outcome parameter we chose this as the primary outcome parameter for our purposes because we were aware of the possible lack of clinical significance of bacteriuria our secondary outcome parameters were symptomatic uti fever sepsis and bacteremia therefore postoperative infectious complications were defined as febrile uti and bacteriuria febrile uti and bacteriuria were described according to the clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in korea 14 use of antibiotics all patients received an initial intravenous antibiotics 30 to 60 min before surgery the oral antibiotics were the same type as the intravenous antibiotics used previously the selection of intravenous antibiotics was chosen according to physician preference statistics statistical analysis was performed using the spss software version 17.0 spss inc chicago il usa descriptive analysis was performed to assess patient demographics univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses stepwise backward procedure were performed to assess the associations of clinical parameters with infectious complications statistical significance was set at p 0.05 for all analyses ethics statement the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the chonnam national university hwasun hospital irb approved protocol no 2012 177 all of subjects submitted informed consent results baseline demographics the mean age of the enrolled patients was 69.1 7.0 yr the mean prostate volume was 55.8 54.5 ml of all 424 patients 215 underwent transurethral prostate surgery and 209 patients underwent open or laparoscopic prostate surgery the mean durations of the operative intravenous antibiotic administration and postoperative foley catheter placement were 165.1 91.6 min 3.4 2.3 days and 9.0 6.4 days respectively the frequency of dm recent uti preoperative uti and preoperative foley catheter placement were 17.9 8.0 7.5 and 11.8 respectively a first or second generation cephalosporin was given to 369 87.0 patients and a third generation cephalosporin to 51 12.0 patients table 1 postoperative infectious complications developed in 149 34.9 paients including postoperative bacteriuria 29.0 fever 9.2 and bacteremia 0.2 table 1 clinical parameters associated with postoperative infectious complications univariate analysis indicated that long term 5 days foley catheterization or 2.44 95 ci 1.59 3.73 p 0.001 operation time or 1.02 95 ci 1.01 1.05 p 0.006 transurethral prostate surgery or 0.42 95 ci 0.28 0.64 p 0.001 dm or 1.66 95 ci 1.03 2.75 p 0.049 and third generation cephalosporins or 0.46 95 ci 0.23 0.93 p 0.032 were risk factors for postoperative infectious complications however the prostate volume or 0.99 95 ci 0.99 1.01 p 0.052 and a duration of intravenous antibiotic administration 72 hr or 1.52 95 ci 0.99 2.33 p 0.055 showed borderline significance table 2 multivariate analysis revealed that dm adjusted or 1.99 95 ci 1.09 3.65 p 0.025 and operation time adjusted or 1.08 95 ci 1.03 1.13 p 0.004 were independently associated with postoperative infectious complications table 3 culture results among the patients who had postoperative bacteriuria and bacteremia n 124 4 patients had 2 organisms in culture the quinolone resistance microorganisms were identified as escherichia coli n 4 klebsiella pneumoniae n 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa n 1 enterobacter spp n 1 enterococcus spp n 14 acinetobacter baumannii n 1 and others n 2 thus overall quinolone resistance rate were 19.5 25 128 in addition the results of extended spectrum  lactamase esbl positivity were similar to those of quinolone resistance rate 21.1 table 4 discussion the incidence of postoperative infectious complications after prostate related surgery in this study was 34.9 dm and a long operation time were independently predictive of postoperative infectious complications after prostate related surgery in urologic surgical practice the prevention of postoperative infectious complications is important however few studies have evaluated the risk factors for postoperative infectious complications in such settings the current classes of surgery surgical field contamination were developed and updated for open surgery and to determine the relative risk of surgical wound infection 15 urological interventions have not been classified and the current definitions do not include endoscopic surgery in addition the current guidelines for surgical site infection focus on gastrointestinal surgery 5 the criteria for assessment of contamination categories in open surgery are the type of incision level of spillage and evidence of infection or inflammation uti is not included these guidelines cannot be adapted to urologic prostatic surgery because many urological procedures are associated with urine exposure and endourological procedures whether opening of the urinary tract should be classified as clean or clean contaminated surgery in cases of negative urine culture remains controversial the same applies to endoscopic and transurethral surgery for practical and strategic reasons clean contaminated urologic operations
 should be extended in an extension this classification could theoretically be widened to also cover endoscopic urological procedures the surgical site being the urinary tract and the surgical site infection being uti several studies have shown that these procedures should be considered clean contaminated because urine culture is not always a predictor of bacterial presence and the lower genitourinary tract is colonized by microflora even in the presence of sterile urine 3 16 according to recent criteria for the assessment of level of surgical class surgical field contamination in prostatic urological procedures these procedures are considered contaminated in the presence of a previous history of uti urogenital infection prostatitis presurgical catheterization or controlled bacteriuria 4 in addition there is a paucity of evidence for prophylactic antibiotics and risk factors in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy therefore it is valuable to evaluate the risk factors for postoperative infectious complications related to prostate surgery and the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in the era of antibiotic resistance postoperative uti and bacteremia are the principal complications after turp therefore antibiotic prophylaxis is essential 17 however the most optimal antibiotic regimen and duration of prophylaxis remain to be determined according to the systematic reviews by berry and barratt 18 and qiang et al 19 the incidences of postoperative bacteriuria and bacteremia more severe than uti are approximately 26.0 and 4.4 respectively in this regard the authors concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreases the development of post turp bacteriuria post turp fever sepsis and the need for additional antibiotics post turp in addition there was a trend suggesting higher efficacy with a short course 72 hr of antibiotic prophylaxis than with a single dose regimen 18 no randomized controlled trials on antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo no antibiotics in total prostatectomy have been performed thus there is a lack of baseline data on the infectious profile of this frequently performed operation a few retrospective and prospective cohort studies have evaluated surgical site infections and catheter associated bacteriuria following different antibiotic regimens they concluded that the frequency of wound infection is low and that a single oral antibiotic dose is sufficient 10 11 12 13 the recommended antibiotic phrophylactic regimen for laparoscopic surgery is similar to that for open surgery because laparoscopic surgery is thought to be less invasive the incidence of surgical site infection in laparoscopic procedures could be lower than that in open procedures rassweiler et al 20 reported that surgical site infection occurred in 5 of 219 2.3 patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy while in just 1 of 438 0.3 undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy studies on antimicrobial prophylaxis in radical prostatectomy are rare and most focused on surgical site infection and not uti as in turp no consideration has been given to postoperative uti in prostatectomy which carries a higher risk of bacteriuria than does turp because of the long term postoperative catheterization in prostatectomy in the present study the postoperative infectious complications rate was 34.9 and included postoperative bacteriuria 29.0 fever 9.2 and bacteremia 0.2 the mean duration of antibiotic administration was 3.4 days but neither the duration of antibiotic administration nor the type of surgery affected the postoperative infectious complications these data show that prostatectomy is associated with a high incidence of postoperative uti and bactremia as is turp from this perspective it is logical to apply the antibiotic prophylaxis regimen of turp to prostatectomy in turp the prophylactic effect of multiple doses of cephalosporins for 24 to 72 hr is more effective than that of a single dose 18 19 in the japanese guidelines radical prostatectomy is considered to be a clean contaminated operation therefore antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended within 3 days 21 in asia the incidence of antibiotic resistance is higher than that in western or european countries which recommend single dose or 24 hr antibiotic prophylaxis thus antibiotic prophylaxis within 3 days might be appropriate for asian countries in terms of antibiotic type there is a lack of evidence to suggest the routine use of one class of antibiotics versus another with aminoglycosides fluorquinolones cephalosporins and tmp smx all demonstrating efficacy in large meta analyses 18 in our study third generation cephalosporins reduced the incidence of postoperative infectious complications on the univariate analysis but did not result in a significant change in the multivariate analysis therefore the prophylactic efficacy did not differ according to the antibiotic type and a first or second generation cephalosporin is a reasonable option to reduce antibiotic resistance several studies have investigated risk factors for postoperative infectious complications after turp 6 9 16 22 23 well documented risk factors are preoperative bacteriuria duration of the operation rupture of closed drainage systems and duration of postoperative catheterization in the present study as in previous studies the operation time adjusted or 1.08 95 ci 1.03 1.13 p 0.004 was a risk factor for postoperative infectious complications the operation time was dependent upon surgeon experience and resected volume in turp in accordance wagenlehner et al 16 added surgeon experience as a risk factor and our previous study revealed resected volume as a risk factor 24 however the current study was a multicenter study and enrolled patients underwent radical prostatectomy or open prostatectomy this is why we did not include surgeon experience or resected volume as risk factors for analysis a history of preoperative or recent uti and the duration of postoperative catheterization were not risk factors for postoperative complications in our study this result may explained by the effective preoperative eradication of uti and well managed closed drainage systems after the procedure in our study another risk factor for postoperative complications was dm adjusted or 1.99 95 ci 1.09 3.65 p 0.025 the independent role of dm in infectious complications is still controversial 25 however in a recent prospective study from japan poor postoperative blood glucose control was directly correlated to an increased rate of infectious complications 26 a stable and normal blood sugar level is considered to be important before during and after surgery 27 it is also recognized that bacteriuria is more often present in individuals with dm and it is more severe and lasts longer 28 because bacteriuria is a well defined risk factor for postoperative infectious complications patients with dm must have a controlled blood glucose level and no bacteriuria prior to surgery in addition because the incidence of dm is increasing in most societies we can assume that there will be an increasing number of infectious complications the current study was not without drawbacks first the antimicrobial regimens and durations were not standardized thus our findings should be interpreted cautiously because each center has different clinical practice guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery there is possible bias related to the quality control between different centers however in line with the recent evaluation of prophylactic antibiotic use for prostate surgery a variety of antibiotics are being used prophylactically with varying duration depending on the hospital therefore we sought to assess the practice of antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate surgery in korea second we did not consider locoregional antimicrobial resistance in our selection of antibiotics finally heterogeneous population and operative methods can lead to the possibility of an unknown cofounder associated with infectious complications however to our knowledge this is the first study in korea to evaluate postoperative infectious complications after prostate surgery no previous studies have investigated the risk factors for postoperative uti after prostatectomy 29 30 with a paucity of korean data addressing this issue the present study will serve as a basis for future prospective research evidence concerning perioperative infections in the urological field is limited the importance of postoperative bacteriuria which is observed in the majority of the patients is unknown further studies on long term complications in patients with postoperative uti such as patients with chronic prostatitis and urethral stricture will be required further studies to gather additional evidence are necessary to establish korean guidelines in conclusion based on our results a prolonged operation time and the presence of dm affect postoperative infectious complications associated with prostate surgery neither the type duration of prophylactic antibiotics nor the type of surgery resulted in a difference in infectious complications additional research with multicentric prospective well designed randomized controlled trials is needed to further evaluate infectious complications after prostate surgery

Q 1 introduction recent advancements in depth imaging sensors technologies have resulted in effective and inexpensive depth cameras which are actively used for 3d motion capture surveillance systems and activity recognition 1 3 these depth cameras sensors 4 6 produce high quality depth i e distance images and are getting a lot of attention due to their potential use in human computer interaction and multimedia contents analysis in the area of depth imaging system a depth human body silhouette is extracted the background is discarded and its information contents are analyzed for its use in application areas such as human tracking monitoring and user recognition systems 7 9 one major application of these systems is human activity recognition har 10 12 depth images could be used to monitor and recognize daily activities of residents i e elderly children or disabled people in indoor environments i e smart homes smart office and smart hospitals and turn these environments into an intelligent living space i e smart environments by making residents respond to the needs of residents 13 also monitoring human activities of daily living is an essential way to describing the functional and health status of human thus we set the aim of this study to develop an efficient depth based life logging system that monitors the activities of residents 24 h day and comfort their life at home life logging is defined as a virtual diary that contains information records i e logs such as a human s daily activities performed in indoor environments detected via har usually various sensors such as motion sensors video sensors or rfid are utilized in life logging har 14 16 the life logging har system provides continuous monitoring and recording of resident s daily activities which is used for future reference to improve the quality of life by assigning life habits and patterns to users also this system can help the users schedule their life e g exercise time taking medicine office time and taking meals according to their life style 17 in general har systems mainly deal with two different sensor devices to record the data such as video sensors and wearable sensors 18 20 in the video based life logging har system video cameras are used to collect video data which contains activity silhouettes of residents in 21 the authors considered video monitoring techniques where the human activities are analyzed in a large crowd using digital cameras and process information log as date time and crowd situations to improve safety and security at public areas in the wearable based life logging har system multiple sensors are attached to the human s body parts in 22 the authors described the system based on body worn microphones and accelerometers attached on different parts of the body to recognize daily activities however it was inconvenient for the subjects to have different sensors attached to them in addition these sensors required wire connections which made use uncomfortable for the subject when keeping the sensors on their body for a long time many researchers have adopted rgb data or depth images for vision based har systems where feature sets are generated from digitized visual data or video sequences in 23 the authors proposed different parametric models to capture the nature of shape deformations of a person s silhouette as discriminating features and provide har results using nonparametric models employing digital cameras in 24 niu and mottaleb used motion and shape features for recognizing human activities from rgb data optical flow vectors are used to represent motion eigenshape vectors are used to represent the shape of each frame in the video and hmm is used for activity recognition in 25 the authors discussed a logging har system that captures videos from multiple cameras which could track and analyze human activities in real environments and then store the information in a log database for future reference in 26 the authors used local spatio temporal features to learn the shapes of the space time neighborhood characteristics that are most discriminative for a given activity using different datasets and recognized activities based on a support vector machine approach using depth cameras the authors of 27 developed two state of the art feature representation methods namely spatio temporal interest points stips and motion history images mhis to create a home monitoring oriented human activity recognition database based on a linear svm in 20 the authors proposed a novel depth vision based translation and scaling invariant har system which recognizes home human activities in 1d feature profiles through r transform via depth silhouettes and stores the data as a log in 28 zhang and parker developed a 4 dimentional 4d local spatio temporal feature that computes and concatenates the intensity and depth gradients within a 4d hyper cuboid which is centered at the detected feature points and used for the task of activity recognition with the lda model as a classifier due to the occasionally problematic behavior of wearable sensors during har we use video cameras for the proposed life logging har system which utilizes the depth silhouettes captured by the depth camera these silhouettes are tracked properly and produce skeleton joint points of the body parts of each activity these joint points are computed for feature extraction and processed for training testing routines the system then includes training routines and recognition for life logging the training phase of our system includes extraction of body skeletons from human depth silhouettes identification of body joint points and computation of motion parameters features from the body joints which are used for training of the har engine finally after training the system it recognizes learned activities via trained hidden markov models hmms for har and stores life log information in a database to the best of our knowledge there are very few works that design and implement an intelligent activity recognition toolbox using depth cameras based on life logging interface especially for elder people our proposed system is mainly focused on providing solutions to certain issues for the elderly people as first it provides an intelligent environment for ambient assisted living includes scene home office hospital activity monitoring and assistance for elder people during risk factors controls the environment and generates a log of everyday life routines which can be properly examined by doctors or nurses to improve the quality of life second it provides special services for the older people such as reducing the mortality rate and overcoming extensive resource utilization for instance mortality rate and health problems are increasing enormously due to unsatisfactory healthcare and living alone facilities for the elderly in the european countries 29 to deal with such circumstances it is necessary to establish a personalized healthcare service that monitors the daily routines of elderly people which not only reduce the mortality rate factor but also allows them to move freely as compared to institutional care or nursing homecare according to a world health organization survey the population of older people is rapidly increasing all over the world and their healthcare needs are becoming more complex which consumes more resources i e human and healthcare expenditures 30 consequently our system provides services i e a single camera system which overcomes the extensive resource utilization issue and improves the quality of life of elderly people third the problems of similar postures of different activities are recognized by our proposed method our work is mainly focused on the development of a complete life logging har system which provides data collection activity training feature extraction modeling recognition and log generation at a single powerful framework having a user friendly interface and thus represents a major contribution in the field of har based on depth sensors the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the life logging har system methodology that includes silhouette preprocessing body skeleton modeling and feature generation followed by activity training and recognition using hmm section 3 describes the experimental results of both the conventional and proposed approaches finally section 4 concludes the paper with some comments 2 proposed life logging har methodology our life logging har system consists of depth silhouettes captured from the depth camera which are further processed for body joint identification motion feature generation from the joint points and training them via hmm for har an overview of the proposed life logging har system is shown in figure 1 where figure 1a describes how to train the life logging system and figure 1b shows how to generate life logs from the recognized activities 2.1 silhouette preprocessing initially the system records users daily activities from a depth camera that provides a sequence of depth silhouettes the input sensor for our system is a microsoft kinect depth camera that provides rgb images and depth maps based on distance or depth information having noisy background and obstacles in the scenes thus we applied background subtraction routine tracking human depth silhouettes and produce body skeleton models for feature generation in addition we made a comparative study between binary and depth silhouettes to find the best silhouette nature 31 33 after getting the depth silhouettes we converted it into binary silhouettes using a simple threshold values figure 2 illustrates examples of depth and binary silhouettes where figure 2a b represents the sequential binary and depth silhouettes of a hand clapping activity and figure 2c d represents the sequential binary and depth silhouettes of a cooking activity respectively from figure 2 it is obvious
 that the binary silhouettes do not seem good enough to differentiate these two different activities because the binary silhouettes deal with limited information i e 0 and 1 values however depth silhouettes clearly differentiate body parts of different activities by means of different intensity values depth silhouettes also deal with hidden feature information which significantly improves the recognition results especially in case of closer activities however during silhouette based har depth silhouettes reflect a superior recognition rate than the binary one see section 3.5 below thus due to the better discrimination of different activities of depth silhouettes we considered the depth silhouettes for further processing in our life logging har system 2.2 training phase of the life logging har system for the training phase of the life logging system a sequence of depth silhouettes captured by a depth camera is processed to identify body joint points the body joint points are used for generating features and the generated features are trained via hmm for the life logging har system 2.2.1 body skeleton model from a sequence of depth silhouettes the corresponding skeleton body models are produced each skeleton model is quite flexible along with any body movement activity 34 35 figure 3 illustrates some skeleton models of different activities in indoor environments 2.2.2 joint points identification each human silhouette is described by a rigid skeleton containing fifteen joint points we extract this skeleton using a human tracking system provided by open ni nite primesence ltd washington dc usa 36 37 these fifteen joint points represent the features of the head arms torso hip and legs each joint point has three coordinates at the frame t these coordinates are normalized so that the motion is invariant to the body position body orientation and the body size especially during the testing interface the depth values of joint points location in the human silhouettes 38 40 encode the presence of the features however to find the frontal face during human tracking a face detector can be used to detect faces 41 42 figure 4 shows the body joint points of different activities of their respective skeleton models 2.2.3 motion parameters for feature representation these features compute the position information of body joint points of motion activity the motion parameter s magnitude of the i th joint point between the t 1 and t frame can be expressed as 1 mi t i 115 xi t 1 xi t 2 yi t 1 yi t 2 zi t 1 zi t 2where x _ i t y _ i t and z _ i t are x y position and depth value respectively at the i th joint point in the t frame therefore the motion parameter s magnitudes 43 of 15 joint points becomes a vector of 1 15 figure 5 shows a set of magnitude features of human activities in various smart environment scenarios used in the life logging har system where a is exercise and watching the tv in a smart home environment b is working on computer and reading an article in a smart office environment and c is taking medicine and lying down is a smart hospital environment respectively directional angle features provide an estimate of angles between the motion directions for the features that are extracted from the joint points the motion parameter s directional angles of the i th joint point between the t 1 and t frame 44 45 can be expressed as 2 i tx tan 1 yi t 1 yi tzi t 1 zi t 3 i ty tan 1 zi t 1 zi txi t 1 xi t 4 i tz tan 1 yi t 1 yi txi t 1 xi t i tx i ty and i tz are directional angles along the x y and z axis respectively at the i th joint point in the t frame therefore the motion parameter s angles of 15 joint points becomes a vector of 1 45 figure 6 shows a set of directional angle features of human activities in various smart environments used in the life logging har system where a is exercise and watching tv in a smart home environment b is working on a computer and reading an article in a smart office environment and c is taking medicine and lying down in a smart hospital environment respectively 2.2.4 code representation of motion parameters these joint points features are represented by a motion parameter vector whose size is 1 60 then they are symbolized by the codebook that is generated by a k mean clustering algorithm 46 one input joint point feature is represented by the code that corresponds to have the minimum distance between the input joint point feature and the code s joint point feature however trained data get generated per each sequence and maintained by buffer strategy 47 49 figure 7 shows the basic steps of codebook generation and code selection of joint points features 2.2.5 hmm training for each human activity after obtaining the code values of motion parameters features we train the hmm 50 51 that is used in the life logging har system in the har system four state left to right hmms are used to model the human activities while the transition matrix is uniformly initialized according to the transition between the states thus hmms are trained based on the baum welch parameter estimation algorithm 52 each activity is represented by a specific hmm figure 8 illustrates the structure and transition probabilistic parameters that are trained for the hmm of an exercise activity to recognize an activity the feature vector as symbol sequence obtained from the codebook generation and symbol selection are applied on all the trained hmms to calculate the likelihood and one is chosen having highest probability thus to test a feature vector sequence o the hmms act as 5 decision argmaxi 1 2 n pr o hi where decision is based on likelihood of o on corresponding trained activity hmm h_i 2.2.6 recognition and life log generation after hmm training the trained life logging har system accepts a sequence of depth silhouettes and generates the life logs by recognizing the learned activities which stores information such as activity type date time location and number of occurrence for future references 3 experimental results and discussion in this section we explain the experimental setting then we define the interface of the life logging har system with both training and recognition modules finally we compare the activity recognition results between the proposed and the conventional methods 3.1 experimental settings for the experimental setting the smart indoor activity datasets are distributed into smart environments and 6 7 h of everyday depth video data were gathered over a week the proposed system is evaluated in a smart room used for three different simulated smart environments that include a home office and hospital where all facilities are provided according to their environment and different activities are performed with respect to their particular situation the experiments have been carried out on a group of six elderly subjects within an age range of 58 72 years for several hours during training testing to measure the accuracy of the detected activities recognized by the proposed life logging har system these elderly people were instructed to perform all activities freely and randomly as they would do in daily life without any instructions on how the life logging system would interpret their movements which made it as a real living space during the depth video recording a fixed depth camera was hung at the top corner of the wall for each smart indoor environment separately these depth videos are recorded at different time of different days under changing lighting conditions from early morning midday to late night during feature approaches comparison the feature vector size remained constant at 1 60 for training the system a total of 40 video clips from each activity were used to build the training data each clip contains 20 frames thus the whole training dataset contained a total of 4800 activity depth silhouettes for each smart environment separately in testing six different activities of all three indoor environments are performed giving a total of 65 video clips recorded in their respective smart environments for several hours however all datasets were collected in a regular indoor setting with no body occlusion from the view of the camera to reduce unreliable depth map factors each subject was requested to move and perform activities within a specific range of 1.3 m to 3.5 m which helped extract a reasonable skeleton size and reliable depth silhouettes thus to restrict our camera path range our datasets continuously provided ideal silhouettes of people the proposed life logging approach integrates efficiently in smart environments without significantly increasing computations and operated at a frame rate of 12 frames per second during testing 3.2 smart indoor activity datasets to evaluate our method we constructed smart indoor activity datasets using the kinect device the videos were collected in home office and hospital environments as shown in figure 9 the datasets are quite challenging because many of the activities in the datasets are highly similar to each other also subjects are freely and randomly performing the various activities thus the trajectories of their movement make our datasets more challenging to explain a clear picture of our datasets figure 10 shows some sample depth silhouettes of all three smart indoor activity environments furthermore some sequential activities having skeleton representations that illustrate our datasets are shown in figure 11 3.3 interface of the life logging har system 3.3.1 training phase the training phase includes the data collection from the depth camera computing motion parameter features and then training on the different activities via hmm in data collection the interface contains rgb images depth maps having background depth silhouettes and skeleton models with their respective joint points information as shown in figure 12 then the joint points information are used to compute
 motion parameters features based on different activities which are further trained via hmm as shown in figure 13 3.3.2 recognition and life logging finally the random input activities of indoor environments are recognized using hmm and these recognized activities are stored as life logs as shown in figure 14 each life log includes activity name time date and number of occurrence in a life log database as soon as a new activity is recognized the life log database gets updated 3.4 comparison study for different number of states of hmm during training testing our datasets we selected the hidden number of states from 3 to 6 for training the hmms and recognizing activities table 1 shows that we can get the best recognition rate when the number is 4 however when we kept improving the hmm state number there was little effect on our recognition so we adapted four hidden states for our proposed har system for recognizing all indoor activity environments considering the processing time of har for the smart home smart office and smart hospital datasets they were three hidden states required 13 12 12 fps four hidden states needed 12 12 11 fps five hidden states took 9 8 8 fps and six hidden states needed 7 6 5 fps on a standard pc it is concluded from above observations that hmm having a number of four hidden states still guarantees good performance both in terms of recognition rate and computational time 3.5 silhouette based har comparison using proposed motion features to evaluate the recognition rate of both binary and depth silhouettes silhouette based har are performed based on proposed motion features as shown in table 2 the recognition results of silhouettes based har experiments reflect the superiority of the depth silhouettes over the binary ones 3.6 feature based har comparison using smart indoor activity datasets in this experiment we compare the proposed life logging approach using motion feature a with the approach using conventional features such as the principle component pc 53 and independent component ic features 54 where pc features of the depth silhouettes were extracted from each activity for global feature extraction and ic features were extracted from each activity for local feature extraction the proposed system analyzed continuous activities performed in indoor environments i e smart home smart office and smart hospital by different subjects at certain hours in a day tables 3 5 compare the recognition results of the proposed life logging approach with the conventional methods using the depth silhouettes for smart home activities from tables 3 5 it is concluded that 1 the proposed motion features shows the highest mean recognition rate among the three different features and 2 pairs of activities such as exercise and cooking and hand clapping and cleaning have low recognition rates in the conventional approaches due to their closer postures in smart home environments tables 6 8 compare the recognition results of the proposed life logging approach with the conventional approaches using depth silhouettes in a smart office environment however pairs of activities such as sitting down and a phone conversation and reading an article and working on a computer have low recognition rates in the conventional approaches due to the complex and similar sequences in a smart office environment from tables 9 11 it is concluded that 1 the proposed motion features shows a significant improvement with recognition results as high as 90.33 while the conventional features achieved low recognition rates of 72.25 and 78.33 in a smart hospital environment and 2 the recognition rate in the hospital environment is the lowest in all indoor environments due to its complexity and the closer postures such as headache chest pain and vomiting also it is concluded that the proposed motion features of depth silhouettes provide better feature generation in the case of closer activities instead of global information extracted from pc features and local information extracted from the ic features thus the overall comparison among the conventional and proposed approaches showed that proposed skeleton joints features provided stronger features and a higher recognition rate than the pca and ir transform features respectively in addition the proposed har system achieves the best performance under various assumptions such as firstly the sensor a camera can be used from any angle for both front and side view however it remains stationary during the whole activity duration secondly human depth silhouettes are clearly distinguished from the noisy background thirdly coordinates of the 15 joint positions are properly identified before training testing the engine fourthly an individual only performs one activity at a time rather than overlapping or concurrent ones lastly feature vector produced hidden states are meaningful sequences and mostly unique for each activity 3.7 comparison and analysis of the proposed har system with the existing har systems the performance of the proposed har system is compared against six conventional methods 55 60 for all three smart indoor activity environments for har all these methods are implemented by us using the instructions provided by their respective papers table 12 shows the depth silhouettes based experimental results where the proposed har system shows a superior recognition rate and outperformed the existing har systems we compare the recognition rate of the proposed har system to that of 55 as 55 achieved the highest recognition rate in the above experiments among the six conventional methods where mostly methods used hmm as a recognition engine this method 55 used spatiotemporal features which are quite sensitive to scaling translation and alignment of silhouettes thus due to these factors our proposed har system provides more satisfactory recognition rate over this conventional method 55 in addition the computational time of har taken by 55 for smart home smart office and smart hospital datasets is 8 9 6 fps respectively on the other hand the proposed har system took 12 fps for the smart home dataset 12 fps for the smart office dataset and 11 fps for the smart hospital dataset thus it is clearly justified that the proposed har system shows significant improvement over conventional methods in terms of recognition rate and computational time which make it more effective for real world applications 3.8 msrdailyactivity3d dataset the msrdailyactivity3d dataset 61 consists of daily activities captured by microsoft research using a kinect device there are sixteen activities which include drink eat read book call on cellphone write on a paper use laptop use vacuum cleaner cheer up sit still toss paper play game lie down on sofa walk play guitar stand up and sit down the total number of activity samples in which ten subjects are involved is 320 this dataset has been designed to cover human daily activities in a living room also this dataset is quite challenging because most of the activities involves human object interactions during experiment results we used a cross subject training testing setup in which we take out each subject i e leave one subject out scheme from the training set and repeat an experiment for each of them table 13 shows the confusion matrix of the proposed method using msrdailyactivity3d dataset the proposed method is also compared against other state of the art methods as reported in table 14 in addition other state of the art methods such as the actionlet ensemble method 61 that deals with local occupancy information based on the local 3d point cloud around each joint fourier temporal pyramid features an actionlet model based on kinematic joints and a multiple kernel learning approach provides 85.7 recognition rate and the althloothi et al method 63 which deals with multi fused features i e motion of 3d joint positions and shape information along with multiple kernel functions achieves a 93.1 recognition rate however the actionlet method 61 used high ordering features and complicated learning procedures while the multi fused features 63 method used large dimensionality features which may be unreliable for postures with self occlusion and needs high computational times that make it impractical for long term har and real time applications meanwhile our proposed har system is quite simple and fast for computation purposes and provides sufficient and compact feature information 4 conclusions in this paper we have presented an efficient depth video based life logging har system utilizing skeleton joints features generated by depth video sensors it includes software routines for training data collection feature generation and training hmms however our proposed har system utilizes magnitude and directional angular features from the joint points of the skeleton model once the life logging har system is trained the system can be activated to produce life logs by recognizing the learned human activities our experimental results showed the promising performance of the proposed life logging har technique achieving mean recognition rates of 92.33 93.58 and 90.33 over the conventional methods having pc features as 78.42 77.83 and 72.25 and ic features as 82.58 82.25 and 78.33 in smart indoor environments the proposed system should be useful in many consumer application systems to monitor and generate life logs of human activities or behaviors which improve the quality of life in future work we aim to exploit the effectiveness of the proposed system especially in the case of occluded regions and more complex activities by introducing some hybrid approach where the proposed system is combined with some body parts labeling method or discriminative generative modeling 64 65 for poses to extract missing skeleton joints during occlusion which should make our human activity recognition algorithm more powerful

Q 1 introduction nondestructive testing methods are used for determining the strength of building materials and products these usually include the rebound hammer method and the ultrasonic pulse method strength is determined from the calibration relation between a parameter obtained from nondestructive tests and compressive strength compressive strength can be assessed either separately for each used method and or on the basis of several parameters from nondestructive tests combined nondestructive methods nondestructive testing methods are used to the largest extent for assessment of concrete quality built in a structure testing and assessment procedures are codified in technical standards for example iso 1920 7 1 astm c805 2 astm 597 3 csn en 12504 2 4 and csn en 12504 4 5 knowledge about nondestructive testing of concrete with rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse method is stated in various technical literatures like 6 9 rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse method are also used for testing of other construction materials knowledge about testing cement and concrete paving blocks with nondestructive methods ultrasonic pulse method cement and concrete paving blocks is stated for example in 10 11 testing concrete paving blocks with rebound hammer is stated in 10 problems of determination of compressive strength of bricks clay brick calcium silicate brick are described for example in aliabdo and elmoaty 12 brozovsky 13 and mccann and forde 8 measurement with rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse method is influenced by various factors for example components and composition of tested material moisture content temperature of the material during testing state of the surface of tested area inner defects of the material or position of sounders for ultrasonic pulse measurement most of knowledge about influence of various factors on results of measurement with nondestructive methods for concrete is stated in 6 7 14 the author examined selected factors with influence on measurements with ultrasonic pulse method and rebound hammer for calcium silicate bricks and clay bricks the knowledge is given in publications 15 17 for the method of rebound hammer influence of temperature and moisture content of bricks was observed 16 as well as the influence of internal tension of the specimen on the rebound value 17 for the ultrasonic pulse method and the influence of moisture content and mode of sounding direct semidirect 15 the combined nondestructive methods are based on two or more nondestructive methods more parameters obtained from these methods define the monitored property of a material or product more accurately for example the strength characteristics of concrete are influenced by various factors such as concrete components precision of batching production technology the manner of processing and climatic conditions during concrete pouring and how the hardened concrete is treated for tests using the combined nondestructive method if there is a certain degree of correlation dependence between two variables it can be assumed that multiple correlation dependence between one and two variables will show a higher degree of correlation application of the combined nondestructive method is based on tests using the rebound hammer method and ultrasonic pulse method which is also called the sonreb method and is developed mostly for determining compressive strength of concrete testing methodology is specified in the ndt 4 rilem directive 18 relationships for determining compressive strength from ultrasonic pulse velocity and the rebound number are quoted in a series of professional publications for example 19 23 this paper provides information on testing of calcium silicate bricks csb using the combined method specifically the combination of ultrasonic pulse method and rebound hammer method sonreb 2 materials and methods 2.1 basic characteristics of calcium silicate bricks the basic raw materials for the production of calcium silicate units are airy lime and silica sand a very important element of the production of sand lime brick is called autoclaving during this process dried bricks are loaded into an autoclave where they are exposed to synergistic effect of elevated temperature the temperature range is 170 c to about 195 c and adequate pressure saturated steam pressure approximately 16 bars course of the heating dwell times and steam pressure is selected according to parameters of raw materials effect of boundary conditions defined in this way creates an environment for the emergence of the so called hydrothermal reaction under these specific conditions silicon dioxide reacts significantly with the calcium oxide the products of hydrothermal reactions are mainly the calcium hydrosilicate phases these phases could be crystalline or gel de facto amorphous phase the most significant product of autoclaving is tobermorite other holders of the mechanical properties of autoclaved matrices are xonotlite summarily c_5 s_5 h respectively afwillite and so forth measurements were taken on two sets of calcium silicate bricks from various times of production test results with nondestructive methods are influenced by technological factors pressing force density of the structure and defects in the inner structure calcium silicate bricks of the format 290 140 65 mm were used for experiments they featured the following basic parameters compressive strength f _c 16.5 61.5 mpa density of dried bricks d 1661 1874 kg m_3 number of calcium silicate bricks in a set 140 2.2 experimental method test equipment the l type schmidt rebound hammer initial impact energy of 0.735 nm tico ultrasonic instrument accuracy of 0.1  s and natural frequency of transducers 82 khz the given frequency of transducers was selected so that the wave length ratio  to the least sample size in the direction of direct sound transmission d _min was less than 1 for reasons of limiting any lowering of ultrasonic pulse velocity ultrasonic pulse velocity in tested samples ranged between 1.6 and 3.1 km s the ratio  d _min corresponds to these values which equals 0.30 respectively 0.58 that is the given condition was complied with condition of samples during testing they are dried to a constant weight rebound hammer method rm a test sample was placed in the compression test machine and loaded by a force corresponding to 10 of the final compressive strength 24 measurements of rebound numbers r _i were taken on each brick the average r was calculated from respective rebound numbers r _i obtained from the test sample and such numbers that differed from the average by more than 14 were excluded the given limit for outlaying values is based on the analysis quoted in 10 minimum count of valid numbers for the sample to be classified into the assessed set was 20 ultrasonic pulse method upm measurements were taken by direct sound transmission along the length of a calcium silicate brick in 5 measuring points m p see figure 1 ultrasonic pulse velocity was calculated from 1 v lt where v is ultrasonic pulse velocity km s l is length of measuring base mm and t is transit time  s compressive

methods they are indicted in figures 2 and 3 3.1 relationships for prediction of compressive strength from ndt based on test results using the least square method the relationships 2 4 for determining compressive strength were obtained from the nondestructive test parameters rebound hammer schmidt type l is 2 fc l 1. 9102r 27.687 r 0.96 ultrasonic pulse method is 3 fc u 2. 3007e1 0253v r 0.96 combined method sonreb is 4 fc sr 0. 255082v1 246413r1 .0559 r 0.97 to assess the applicability of processed relationships the residual standard deviation was determined which expresses the difference between the compressive strength value determined destructively and the compressive strength value calculated from the respective relation the residual standard deviation s for n measured points of the calibration relationship is calculated according to 5 s i 1n di dm 2n k where d _i is calculated according to 6 and d _m according to 7 as 6 di fci fcdifcdi 7 dm i 1ndin where f _ci is compressive

relationships are regarded as practically applicable in which s 0.12 and which have no local minimum or maximum inside their range residual standard deviations of processed relationships 2 4 for the prediction of compressive strength of calcium silicate bricks obtained from the nondestructive test parameter are given in table 2 3.2 discussion of the results the processed relations for the prediction of compressive strength obtained from the nondestructive test parameter are known for close correlation between variables irrespective of whether or not the compressive strength was calculated from the relation with one or two parameters taken from nondestructive tests correlation coefficients are within 0.96 to 0.97 and residual standard deviations are within 0.043 to 0.066 the closest relationship between variables is found in the relation processed from the results of measurements using the combined method combination of ultrasonic pulse and rebound method comparison of differences between the actual compressive strength compression test machine and the strengths calculated from calibration relations processed for respective methods is indicated in figure 4 for the sonreb combined
 method the differences between the actual compressive strength and compressive strength obtained from nondestructive tests lie in the interval 7.8 to 6.0 mpa for the ultrasonic pulse method they are in the interval 8.8 to 7.8 mpa and for the rebound hammer method in the interval 9.8 to 6.7 mpa differences in predicted compressive strengths of calcium silicate bricks determined in accordance with relations processed for respective methods are lower than in concretes which can be explained by a lower parameter variability of components of calcium silicate raw material by substantially invariable parameters of production technology by a higher homogeneity of calcium silicate material and by definitely defined moisture condition of samples prior to testing 4 conclusion based on the analysis obtained from the information and processed relationships needed for the prediction of compressive strength of calcium silicate bricks obtained from tests using the ultrasonic pulse method and the rebound hammer method it is possible to state that the given methods are both separately and in combination applicable for the assessment of strength parameters of calcium silicate bricks the highest correlation between parameters from nondestructive measurement and predicted compressive strength was obtained using the sonreb combined nondestructive method however the differences in strengths obtained from the combined method compared with the strengths determined from measurements using a sole method rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse method are not so significant as in concrete testing the processed calibration relationships are known for a high linkage between variables and are applicable in practice combined nondestructive testing sonreb reaches the highest accuracy of the value of expected compressive strength of calcium silicate bricks practical applicability of the sonreb combined nondestructive method was established as a tool used for assessment of compressive strength of calcium silicate bricks both for checking tests in the production plant and for determination of compressive strengths of bricks built in a structure walling setting of specifying coefficient is recommended for practical use of the basic calibration relationship for determination of expected strength of calcium silicate bricks from the measurement by means of the sonreb method 4 for particular production plant or for evaluation of calcium silicate bricks built in the structure for the purpose of checking tests in the production plant of the csb it is recommended to carry on nondestructive measurements and consequent destructive tests of at least 16 bricks with various compressive strengths which will help set the specifying coefficient specifying coefficient for compressive strength of calcium silicate bricks built in a structure wall is set on at least 3 bricks which were selected on the basis of results of measurement with sonreb method

Q 1 introduction the reduction of patient discomfort and risk of infection is the main design concern in the implanted device field recently most bio implantable devices are powered using implanted batteries resulting skin infections and hazards because the implanted batteries have chemical side effects and limited lifetime researchers have developed a safer alternative method for powering implantable devices using inductive power links the magnetic inductive link approach is believed to be the most promising technique for implantable devices its advantages include continuous availability of high levels of power to an implanted device and the ability to control it with the external device using the magnetic link in addition the lifetime and shelf life of the implanted devices are not restricted by the lifetime of a battery hence it can be used for long term and during the patient s activities 1 bio implantable devices designed with the smallest possible size are to be implanted depending on functional depth in the human biological tissue which is usually less than 10 mm of depth for example in general implanted micro system stimulators depth is 1 4 mm for retinal implants it is 5 mm and for cochlear implants depth is 3 6 mm respectively 2 4 the inductive powering links method is a suitable method for powering implanted devices this inductive coupling link consists of two rlc circuits acting as a transmitter and receiver coils to obtain better power transfer efficiency pte both rlc circuits are tuned to the same resonant frequency _o the external rlc circuit fixed outside the body is tuned to the serial resonance to provide a low impedance load to deliver maximum power from the source to the implanted circuit the internal rlc circuit is implanted within the body and tuned to the parallel resonance to improve the driving performance for remote load resistance 5 7 many design issues should be considered such as patient comfort endurance portability reliability size power consumption and feasibility most implanted microsystems are used to stimulate and monitor biological signals in the near field region such as nerves and muscle activities in addition the development of implanted microsystems will helps biological research to recognize and develop treatments for nerve diseases such as brain disorders i e epilepsy stroke and paralysis power transmission is the key in designing such bio implantable devices the power transfer efficiency is affected by the coil parameters including their lumped elements such as parasitic resistance and capacitance associated with them geometries alignments and distance between coils the mutual distance between the transmitter external and receiver implant coils is to be smaller than the wavelength in the near field which depends on the coil dimensions hence the coil dimensions have a direct effect on the distance and a coupling link which consists of two differing or same sized coils oriented face to face the external coil located outside the body can be accurate with flexibility in the design in terms of size while the implanted coil located within the human body should be as small as possible the implanted coil is the main reason for the power consumption therefore it should be carefully designed in terms of shape and geometry the coupling increases as the coil dimensions increase and as the distance between the coils decreases to provide a coupling link at 10 mm a spiral rectangular coil shape with external and internal dimensions of 62 mm 25 mm and 25 mm 10 mm was designed at 13.56 mhz in this design the relative short range coupling and implanted coil size are the issues 8 a spiral square coil shape with outer and inner dimensions of 70 mm 8 mm and 20 mm 8 mm was designed for 1 mhz to 5 mhz frequency ranges it is seen that the design provides optimum coupling at a distance of 10 mm however for better performance the size and relative short range coupling still need to be considered 9 the coupling links between two circular coil dimensions d_out 38 mm d_in 36 mm and d_out 18 mm d_in 16 mm was designed to offer 15 mm of distance coupling with an operating frequency of 742 khz however this design will increase the printed board circuits and occupies a relatively large area within tissues 10 for eeg signal detection sauer et al designed a coupling link based on circular coils with external coil dimensions of 50 mm and an internal coil of 20 mm to offer 28 mm of distance with an operating frequency of 4 mhz the implanted coil size is still the issue when it occupies a relatively large area 11 printed spiral circular coils psccs are robust against lateral misalignments and reliable for implantation under the skin they can be fitted outside the body or within the epidural space in this study the reflected impedance concept analysis is optimized and modified to obtain efficient power transmission between two pairs of proposed single layer planar spiral circular coils which are printed on small substrate pcbs firstly air separates the two coils then a biological human tissue model with 6 mm of thickness is assumed as a medium between coils which is considered as a relative distance between the coils the tissue thickness of 6 mm is an appropriate depth which is faithful to the distance used for implantable devices such as cochlear implants implanted micro systems and retinal implants 4 the transmitter and receiver had the following respective external and internal dimensions the outer and inner transmitter dimensions are 56 mm and 10 mm respectively and for the receiver implanted coil they are 11.6 mm and 5 mm respectively the circuit was designed to provide a 22 mm of coupling distance using the industrial specific medical ism operating frequency of 13.56 mhz the distance of 22 mm is more than enough for our application because the proposed tissue thickness is no more than 6 mm the geometry of the coil values is recommended by theoretical calculations using matlab to establish the efficiency of the coils the high frequency structure simulator ansoft hfss 13.0 with finite element method fem software in near field is used to simulate and calculate the gain surrounding coils in air and within the tissue it is also used to validate the coil design the semcad software used to calculate the sar within tissue 2 methods and materials an inductive coupling link with serial to parallel topology is a suitable connection for biomedical applications the theoretical analysis and simulation are very important in designing an ideal inductive coupling for estimating the received power different theoretical analysis methods have been investigated for solving and deriving the equations for calculating the received power of the implant device in this paper the reflected impedance method is obtained by modifying the lumped equivalent circuit to quantify and optimize the power transmission efficiency between the two coils the optimization is done when the input impedance is low and when the input impedance is high the medium separating the coils is considered as air free space and biological human tissue separately the simulated biological human tissue model included dry and wet skin having similar constitutive parameters to live human tissue 3 analysis and optimization based on coupling there are four different combinations of highly coupled stagger tuned inductive links they are voltage in voltage out voltage in current out current in current out and current in voltage out the voltage in voltage out link is an approach which can control the output power this approach is based on the coupling used to calculate and optimize the power transmission efficiency 3.1 inductive power transmission efficiency the inductive link with serial to parallel sp topology is the common part between the external and internal architectures which is the suitable topology to be used for subcutaneous implanted devices figure 1 shows the equivalent scheme of the sp topology that consists of two parts external part reader and internal part implant the power transfer efficiency pte is one of the major specifications for assessing the performance of an inductive link 12 figure 2 shows the lumped elements of the equivalent scheme the resistance r_lt and r_lr are equivalent series resistors of inductors l_t and l_r respectively and expressed as follows 1 lt 1c102 2 lr 1c202 3 rlr rload1 02rload2cr2 the parasitic resistor r_lt is model the series resistance of one turn of the inductance this resistor also included the reflected back resistor into the transmitter which is very small and can be ignored m is the mutual inductance between the transmitter inductance l_t and receiver inductance l_r the primary coil driven by the efficient power amplifier which is modeled as a voltage source and having a series resistance r_p the coil windings have umped elements such as parasitic resistance and capacitance associated with them the transmitter and receiver coil lumped elements are r_lt c_st and r_lr c_sr respectively the capacitors c_1 and c_2 are added to form the resonant lc tank circuits for the conductors l_t and l_r respectively and should be chosen to approximately have the same values r_load represents the load resistance and for the simplest analysis c_r c_sr c_2 the efficient power transmission is calculated by using reflected impedance concept analysis from the receiver and transmitter z_t and z_r as given in equations 4 7 4 zt vti1 2m2z2 5 zr vri2

consumed
 by the load r_load over the total power consumed at the implanted side _r as given in equations 8 and 9 respectively 8 t ztz1 zt k2q1q2rloadk2q1q2rload q22rlr 9 r 1 rlrz2 q22rlrq22rlr rload then total link efficiency is _link _t _r where total link efficiency _link reaches its maximum if z_1 and z_2 has only the real part left where the imaginary part is approximately zero q_1 and q_2

the coupling coefficient value is 0 k 1 depends on the coils radius and is calculated as given in the coil optimization section the implanted load resistance r_load is calculated according to 13 as expressed in equation 13 13 rload2 42lr2 0where 2fandrload 2lrwhere hence the r_load 170  in our calculation we assume the r_load values are 200  to 400  by 50  steps where 200  presents the worst case and 400  is an optimum case the total efficiency is a product of _t and _r as illustrated in equation 14 14 total tr k2q1q23rlrrload k2q1q23rlrrload k2q1q2rload2 q24rlr2 2q22rlrrload rload2 the efficiency given in equation 14 is perfect and appropriate in the absence of resistance of the power amplifier source and the low external circuit impedance the inductive coupling circuit is driven with an efficient subcutaneous power amplifier and this makes the external impedance increase and reduces the power delivered to the internal circuit therefore the power amplifier should be carefully designed with optimum load resistance r_p by using a matching network where the lumped elements for the external coil can also be determined 14 the external impedance including the power amplifier resistance is as illustrated as follows 15 z11 rlt jlt 1jcst 1jc1 rp 16 t ztz11 zt the pte equation based on these factors given in the figure 2 becomes 17 link pops k2q1q23rloadrlr k2q1q2rload 1 rprlt rload q22rlr rload q22rlr equations 14 and 17 are modeled in matlab based on the values given in the inductive link coil design section table 1 the power transfer efficiency for lower input impedance is higher than the efficiency with higher input impedance 3.2 optimization of maximum efficiency the purpose of the theoretical analysis given above is to facilitate the process of the inductive coupling link optimization referring to figure 2 the optimization is obtained for impedance z_1 and z_2 by reducing the implanted impedance z_2 without considering the power amplifier resistance the power efficiency takes place at the resonant frequency _o on the implanted coil as follows 18 o imp2 1lrcr 1crrload 2 from equation 18 it is noted that the resonant frequency depends on l_r c_r and r_load hence if there is any change in the implanted load resistance the coupling system will be out of resonance thus the implanted remote will not receive the maximum transmitted power the maximum transmitted power between the two coils is achieved when both lc circuits of the external and implanted coil have the same resonance frequency and the imaginary part of the impedance x_eq 0 and this occurs when the load reflected in the transmitter has the same value as the impedance of the transmitter coil in resonance z_1 as follows 19 pmax m2lr rloadrloadcr 1 rlrwhere m represents the mutual inductance between the external and internal coil which is calculated in the optimization section on the secondary side a resonance capacitor c_r cancels the inductive impedance of the receiving coil the secondary resonance greatly enhances the performance of an inductive link therefore this capacitor playing a big rule in the efficiency enhancement referring to equation 19 the optimization can be achieved by adjusting the capacitor c_r to get optimum resonance as given in equation 20 20 cr rl rl2 4lr2022lrrloado2 hence we optimize the power transmission efficiency of the inductive link which is given in equation 14 without considering the power amplifier resistance that can be expressed as given in equation 21 21 opt i2 2rloadreq i1 vs 22 req rlrrload rload rlr

4 coils design and optimization in general the coil design and optimization can be achieved based on two methods coupling based and coil geometry based the optimization based on coupling is used to optimize the power transfer efficiency data rate transmission voltage gain and bandwidth the optimization based on coil geometry is used to enhance the coil performance in air and within the tissue in this section the methodology to design the inductive link based on spiral circular coil geometry is introduced this optimization can be achieved by developing rules and formulas presented in previous studies the optimization is obtained based on the coil geometry parameters such as coil shape outer and inner dimensions mutual inductance m self inductance l coefficient factor k and fill factor  4.1 spiral coil characterization the hfss software is used to validate and simulate the proposed printed spiral circular coils and design the tissue model in order to reduce the power losses in the transmission load 1 0z copper wire 30 awg with 0.036 mm thickness is printed on rogers 4350 substrate with constitutive parameters of 1.5 mm substrate thickness 4.4 fr4 dielectric constant 3.66 relative permittivity _r 0.004 dielectric loss tangent and 1 relative permeability _r respectively the implanted coil is coated by rh 5 substrate with _r 1.0006 and loss tangent 0 the external coil is printed on a substrate having dimensions of 70 60 1.5 mm while the internal coil is printed on a substrate having dimensions of 12 15 1.5 mm as shown in figure 3 the calculated parameters of the transmitter and receiver coils will be explained in detail in the coil design section and as given in table 1 4.2 optimization of geometric design based on circular spiral coils circular spiral coils are widely used in implanted devices as inductive coupling links due to their robustness against lateral coil misalignment because the external coil is fixed outside the body it can be improved by increasing the dimensions of the coil the design of the internal coil is limited by many factors such as shape weight number of turns and size hence the outer dimension of the implanted coil should be small with a few turns and should have a low consumption to prevent tissue heating the proposed coils are used for the implanted microsystem in the radiating near field fresnel region at an operating frequency of 13.56 mhz in the arrow band the em fields around the coils should be constant and confirm the omnidirectional pattern associated with such loop antennas which allows better links with the implanted coil in the case of circular loops the distance of the radiation d is defined by the outer transmitted coil dimensions d_out and should satisfy the condition adopted by finkenzeller 15 as given in equation 23 23 dout d22 the mutual distance between the transmitter and receiver circular coils should satisfy the expression equation 24 16 which we modified as given in equation 25 24 a x2 b2where a and b represents the external and implanted coils radius respectively 25 dout t2 x2 dout r2 2where x represents the mutual distance between coils and d_out t d_out r presents the external and internal outer dimensions for the transmitter and receiver coil as shown in figure 3 the methods used in calculating the mutual inductance between the two coils and the self inductance of such coils have been previously reported 17 18 and for the spiral circular coils they are adapted from 19 the mutual inductance of two parallel filament coils  0 and separated by x distance and having a d_t and d_r of dimensions can be expressed as follows 26 m dt dr  0 x 120dt dr 2f f k f 2fe f where _0 4 10_ 9 h cm and represent the permeability of space k f e f represents the elliptic integrals given in equation 27 27 f dt dr  0 x 4dtdr dt dr 2 x2 the summations of the partial mutual inductance for both coils need a complex analytical model hence circular coils having a simple mathematical model are proposed and the external and internal coils have a very small space between each turn as given in table 1 therefore lyle s method 20 is used for the considered external and internal coils having two circular filaments with dimensions d_out t d_in t and d_out r d_in r respectively and having an arithmetic geometric average as given in equation 28 28 davg 0.5 dout din where d_out and d_in represent the outer and inner coil dimensions hence the approximated mutual inductance between two spiral circular coils is found as a function of the number of turns for each coil coil dimensions and distance which can be developed and simplified as given in equation 29 15 21 29 m 0ntdout t2nrdout r22 dout r2 x2 3where n_t and n_r are the number of turns of the transmitter and receiver coils the self inductance such as that of the spiral circular planar coil is determined based on the approximation of the spirals and equivalent current densities and be calculated as given in equation 30 30 l c10n2davg2 ln c2 c3 c42 where n represents the numbers of turns for such circular coil c_i is a dependent coefficient in this case it is a circle for which the coefficients are c_1 1.00 c_2 2.46 c_3 0.00 c_4 0.20 18 the arithmetic geometrical averages like the fill ratio defined as  have to be computed and calculated as illustrated in equation 31 31  dout din dout din to design and optimize our spiral circular coil pancake we used two concepts the first one is based on equation 24 where the external coils radius is approximately equal to the distance to be covered for a small internal
 coil on the other hand the mutual distance between the external and implanted coils is about twice the implanted coil diameter the second one is based on the relations between the outer and internal coils then increasing mutual distance can be solved by optimizing the coil dimensions by making d_in t 0.18 d_out t and d_in r 0.75 d_out r respectively 19 using the equation approximations above and the chart from figure 4 the external coil outer dimensions are assumed d_out t 56 mm then d_in t 10 mm the implanted coil dimensions found d_out r 11.6 mm and d_in r 5 mm respectively 22 to validate our design optimization the values above were inserted into equation 25 giving as mutual distance result x 22 mm which is much closer to the radiated distance from the external coil given in equation 23 where d 20 mm the coefficient factor k is calculated based on coils dimensions since its for an implanted microsystem usually d_out t d_out r and according to the values given in table 1 in our applications we used a tissue thickness of 6 mm as a mutual distance between the coils hence the coefficient coupling k is calculated as follows 32 k a2xb2ab a2 x2 3 to validate the parameters m and k equations 29 and 32 were modulated in matlab as shown in figure 4 b respectively for information and clarification the dielectric constitutive parameters of the biological human tissue at low band frequencies such as 13.56 mhz are not available in the specialized scientific research and literature approximate body tissue dielectric data are available in 23 5 human biological tissue and sar at 13.56 mhz the implanted coil receives the energy transferred by external coils through the human tissue therefore the human tissue must be taken into account because it is not allowed to use the living human tissue in testing and cadavers are not suitable for testing because they lose the tissue properties 10 h after death and their temperature becomes lower than 22 in addition the use of the animal tissue e g ground beef pig tissue and mouse tissue does not give the real desired results because of the totally different constitutive parameters between the human and the animal tissue as a solution we designed the biological human tissue model with its constitutive parameters in hfss and used it as a medium separating the two parts the conductivity permeability and the loss tangent of the human tissue are considered in our proposed design while other designers did not consider such constitutive parameters of all types of the tissue layers in their designs or they only considered air as the main medium 9 24 25 they claimed that the frequencies below 20 mhz couldn t damage the tissue so most designers haven t considered the tissue when the operating frequency is lower than 20 mhz or they used only one type of tissue therefore in this work two types of biological human tissue with wet and dry skin are proposed as the medium separating the coils the external coil contacts the skin and the internal coil is implanted within the tissue at a depth of 6 mm hence the magnetic flux links the implanted coil and the external coil and transfers power to the implanted coil each type of proposed human biological tissue consists of three layers the first layer is the skin with 1 mm thickness the second layer is the fat with 2 mm thickness and the third layer is muscle with 3 mm thickness the total tissue dimension is 70 mm 60 mm 6 mm and it is designed using hfss as shown in figure 5 in this process the emf is solved at 13.56 mhz the implanted and external coils surrounding gain was defined on a sphere of radius 12 cm and 28 cm respectively which defines the region around the antenna our chosen frequency is 13.56 mhz and is compared with the international commission on non ionizing radiation protection icnirp and federal communications commission fcc standards both standards require that the sar level be at or below 1.6 wkg_ 1 spread over a volume of 1 g of tissue whereas the sar limit is 2 wkg_ 1 averaged over 10 g of tissue 25 at frequencies lower than 20 mhz the sar is very small compared with the sar standard therefore to validate that the proposed internal coil cannot damage the tissue due to electromagnetic absorption the high accuracy field solver semcad 14.6 was used to calculate the sar using numerical techniques with a finite difference time domain fdtd 6 sar and power losses calculation inside the tissue in order to estimate the power losses inside the human body numerical calculation methods can be used in general determining sar can be achieved by using numerical techniques or experimental methods by using fabricated tissue phantoms where the given results are not close to reality in addition the power losses cannot be determined within tissue 26 other studies have tried to fabricate gels exhibiting similar electrical properties as tissues for testing implantable devices and these gels are used to examine the interaction between electromagnetic waves and biological tissues all this gel was fabricated according to the industrial scientific and medical ism 2.4 2.48 ghz band and according to the medical implant communications service mics 402 405 mhz one 27 the gels are fabricated by making an artificial material which shows electrical features approximately similar to human skin tissue the contents of this material are oil sugar triton agarose nacl and deionized water this fabricated gel suffered from several problems such as quick loss water as a result of the evaporation process and it cannot keep a fixed temperature like the temperature of the human body thus it loses its properties quickly and hence it must be kept in designated places for our work we didn t find any studies that fabricated gels for low band frequency 1 20 mhz in addition we believe that whatever the accuracy of the tissue phantom manufacturer it cannot be absolutely similar to the living human tissue as a solution we used such specific and accurate software simcad with a high resolution 3 d human body model and we selected the position of the implanted coil and the tissue with its real constitutive parameters at 13.56 mhz 28 then to calculate sar and power losses within tissue the implanted coil was designed using pspice which it is compatible with the semcad software and powered it with five voltages and 150 mw then the proposed implanted coil was inserted into the 3d model at the top of the adult human head in the space between the skull and brain at a depth of less than 1 cm the semcad software provides a high level of anatomical details and avoids using practical experiments on live human tissue these models play an important role in optimizing the evaluation of electromagnetic exposures e g in human body models 29 a future task of this study will be to fabricate phantom tissues having constitutive parameters at 13.56 mhz according to 29 but this fabrication may only be done by certain companies 7 results and discussion in this study a theoretical analysis of ps topology inductive coupling links is presented the mathematical analysis is modeled in matlab using the reflected impedance method to determine the power transmission efficiency between the two parts the reflected impedance concept analysis is optimized and modified to obtain efficient power transmission between the two pairs of proposed single layer planar spiral circular coils which are printed on small pcbs made of substrate in the reflected impedance method two approaches were used the first approach is the analysis done without considering the power amplifier resistance and the second approach is with power amplifier resistance the implanted load resistor is considered 200  to 400  and for implanted microsystem purposes the needed distance between coils is 6 mm with a coefficient factor of 0.087 and mutual inductance of 0.95 h figure 6a b shows the variation of power efficiency with various resistances and coefficient factors with high and low input impedance respectively the maximum efficiency without power amplifier resistor is 80 and the worst efficiency is 73 whereas the maximum efficiency with the power amplifier consideration is 45 and the worst efficiency is 32 the results showed that the power efficiency with power amplifier resistance high input impedance is approximately 55 more than that without power amplifier resistance low input impedance to test the proposed coils performance and to find the natural fields surrounding the coil in air and in human biological tissue the model is analyzed and optimized using the commercial field solver hfss 13.0 the coils were investigated in two conditions the first condition was when air free space separated the coils placed at distances of 6 mm the second condition was when simulated human biological tissue with dry and wet skin replaced the air 7.1 near fields surrounding coils on air the combined magnitude of the electric field components elevation and azimuthal planes for external and internal coils in air can be explained as follows figure 7 illustrates the simulated natural e total near field patterns surrounding external coil on air at a distance of 6 mm where figure 7a shows that the total near field on the azimuthal plane  0  90 are approximately 36 db and 3 db respectively and the surrounding fields are omnidirectional at all angles figure 7b shows that the surrounding fields on the elevation plane  0  90 are approximately 3 db and 28 db the magnitude of the electric field surrounding the coil is omnidirectional and there is a drop and change in the magnitude in some specific angles the outer dimensions of the implanted coil are smaller than those of the external coil therefore the gain surrounding the implanted coil is lower than the gain surrounding the external coil figure 8 illustrates the simulated natural fields surrounding the internal coils in air at 6 mm
 distance where figure 8a shows that the total near fields on the azimuthal plane  0  90 are approximately 68 db and 18 db respectively and the magnitude of the electric field surrounding the coil is omnidirectional at all angles figure 8b shows that the total near fields on the elevation plane for both  0  90 are approximately 22 db the magnitude of the electric field surrounding the coil is omnidirectional and there is a drop in the magnitude at some specific angles of up to 48 db 7.2 near fields surrounding coils within tissue the external coil contacts the skin and the internal coil is implanted inside the tissue at a depth of 6 mm therefore the combined magnitude of the electric field components for external and internal coils within tissue can be explained as follows figure 9 illustrates the simulation of the near field patterns e total surrounding the external coil on the azimuthal plane  0  90 and on the elevation plane  0  90 because the external coil just contacts the tissue therefore there is no tissue effect on the coil performance and the amount of the surrounding coil is similar to the results given in figure 7 the internal coil is implanted in the tissue at a depth of 6 mm hence the coil performance is different from the coil performance when it is in free space figure 10 illustrates the simulated natural fields surrounding the internal coils within tissue at a depth of 6 mm figure 10a shows that the total near fields on the azimuthal plane  0  90 are approximately 88 db and 38 db respectively and the magnitude of the electric field surrounding the coil is omnidirectional at all angles except for some specific angles figure 10b shows that the total near fields on the elevation plane for both  0  90 are approximately 38 db the magnitude of the electric field surrounding the coil is omnidirectional and there is a drop in the magnitude for some specific angles of up to 68 db 7.3 specific absorption rate sar effects and power loss one of the important situations of transferring signals via inductive coupling is when the tissue is facing an electromagnetic field such a tissue will derive the power to be dissipated inside the tissue itself therefore the temperature will be increased around the tissue as a result the tissues that surround the coil may be damaged however power dissipation and sar should be within the accepted range in our design the coils are separated by biological tissue thus the sar and power losses of the proposed coils operating at 13.56 mhz would not be damaging to the tissue to prove that the implanted coil was inserted at the top of the head in the space between the skull and brain at a depth of less than 1 cm figure 11 shows the sar level and the power loss within the tissue where the sar is equal 7.09 e_ 021 mw g and the power loss is 1.402 e_ 025 w the results above show that the sar was much less than the standard for 1 g and is negligible for 10 g the power loss effect is negligible both results showed that the proposed implanted coil has a negligible sar and a power loss effect 8 conclusions in this study a theoretical analysis for an inductive coupling link is optimized by using the reflected impedance method to achieve a power transmission efficiency of up to 80 the inductive link based on a spiral circular pancake design was developed and tested in air and in two types of the biological human tissue dry and wet skin having a thickness of 6 mm at a frequency of 13.56 mhz the designed coils can be used for implanted micrssystem applications where the maximum depth is 6 mm as given in the literature review the coil values and geometries are given in table 1 the results showed that the maximum gain surrounding the external coil in the air and on tissue is 3 db and it is almost constant and has an omnidirectional pattern therefore the external coil performance in tissue is approximately 98 than it air the internal coil performance within tissue is approximately 50 that in air the sar is extremely small and lower than the standard level thus the tissue is not heated and cannot be damaged and power loss within the tissue is very small and can be ignored the implant coil dimensions are small and it performed well making it highly suitable for implanted microsystem applications this work supported by the universiti kebangsaan malaysia under grant ukm dip

Q background currently 35.0 of adults in the united states are obese and 33.6 are overweight 1 while us obesity rates have leveled off in recent years 1 the high prevalence of obesity remains a severe threat to the health of americans simply stated obesity is caused by an imbalance in energy intake and expenditure however there are multiple complex factors that influence this equation the rise in obesity in the us has occurred too rapidly to be primarily related to our biology 2 which has led scientists and practitioners to examine changes in the food environment policies and production system as potential drivers 2 3 over the past 40 years the u s food system and food environment has evolved to provide an abundant supply of inexpensive highly palatable high energy foods that are accessible convenient and heavily marketed 3 in this context high obesity rates may be viewed as a natural response to the environment 3 the food environment may be defined as the types of food sources that are accessible to an individual such as supermarkets fast food restaurants convenience stores school meal programs etc and what consumers are exposed to in those environments availability of healthy and unhealthy foods prices promotions marketing etc 2 4 a review of the literature by larson and colleagues 5 found that increased access to supermarkets was related to improvements in diet quality fat intake and fruit and vegetable consumption in studies of both adults and adolescents increased access to grocery stores is generally linked to reduced levels of obesity whereas increased access to convenience stores corner stores and fast food outlets is linked to increased obesity 5 9 additionally low income and minority neighborhoods have disproportionately lower levels of access to healthier food sources i e supermarkets and increased access to less healthy food sources i e fast food convenience stores corner stores 5 10 12 which may contribute to the disparities seen in obesity rates among groups like many cities in the us healthy foods and food source availability is limited in low income areas in baltimore 13 16 these areas have few supermarkets but do have many small food sources including corner stores carry out restaurants and fast food restaurants 13 15 corner stores in baltimore have limited space and stock primarily high fat and high added sugar items 17 baltimore carry outs primarily serve high fat and high sugar foods 18 in 2007 32.7 of baltimore city adult residents were overweight and 35.0 were obese 19 these disparities can be attributed in part to the poor community food environment it is clear that multi level multi component interventions are needed to address the obesity epidemic and that this work needs to take place in low resource settings in the area of childhood obesity prevention the majority of work has taken place in schools with limited impact 20 in recent years a number of trials have combined school based approaches with complementary approaches in the community 21 shape up somerville was one such successful approach using community participatory approaches shape up somerville was designed to prevent undesirable weight gain by intervening within the before during and after school environments of an elementary school child program development involved the engagement of various community members including school food service providers before and after school programs restaurants parents children and others as a result the multi component program led to a decrease in bmi percentile among children 22 despite this success fewer than half of the combined school community intervention trials have successfully reduced obesity in children some limitations of this previous work include lack of attention to policy which is needed for long term sustainability and stakeholder buy in no systematic exploration of the potential for different intervention strategies to work alone and in combination lack of emphasis on the social environment as part of intervention strategies weaknesses in the delivery of the intervention such that intensity and exposure is limited and a near total lack of work on low income urban populations where the risk for obesity and associated negative outcomes is the greatest new approaches are needed that will work at multiple levels combine multiple intervention venues and strategies and that address the significant gaps presented above the b more healthy communities for kids bhck trial is a multi level child obesity prevention intervention supported as part of an u54 grant to the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health to fund the johns hopkins global obesity prevention center the bhck intervention is guided by social cognitive theory sct social ecology and systems theory 23 26 sct and social ecology conceptualize the individual as nested within broad social and environmental networks and structures that impinge on their perceptions outlooks and behaviors figure 1 psychosocial factors e g knowledge intentions and self efficacy social environmental factors e g behavioral observations and physical environmental factors e g food availability price interact at various levels to shape health outcomes 26 32 according to systems theory this dynamic and complex system operates as one whole interacting functional unit in which information and influences flow bi directionally from one level to another policy institutional and behavioral strategies have the potential to reach multiple levels of the food environment the bhck trial seeks to develop and test a series of intervention strategies that will function at multiple interacting levels and will be implemented in collaboration with city officials local wholesaler s and retail food stores carryouts these strategies will improve the healthy food supply chain for low income communities institutional level intervention components e g wholesalers retailers recreation centers and consumers will promote healthy dietary behaviors in order to influence the household e g food purchasing and preparation and individual food related psychosocial factors and behaviors which will ultimately impact risk of obesity emphasis will be placed on institutional and behavioral strategies e g retailer discounts point of purchase promotions and health education which will elicit change at each level figure 1 b more healthy communities for kids conceptual framework methods design the bhck trial uses a group randomized study design where 30 low income geographic zones surrounding recreation centers have been selected to serve as either intervention or comparison areas all areas were required to be predominantly low income and african american half of these zones have been randomized to intervention healthy eating zones hezs while the other half have been set to comparison delayed intervention in two waves the center point recreation center of all intervention and comparison zones must exceed one mile in distance from each other to reduce the potential for contamination the research was approved by the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health institutional review board written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants for themselves and for children written assent was obtained from all children who were part of the evaluation sample formative research extensive formative research was conducted to aid in program planning and materials development methods included in depth interviews and focus groups with youth and their adult caregivers ground truthing of food sources and environmental scans of food availability in depth interviews with youth ages 10 14 and their adult caregivers were conducted to identify key areas for intervention along selection of the most appropriate communication channels and messaging materials ground truthing techniques were used to identify and map food sources in each intervention and comparison neighborhood with over 300 unique food sources documented selection of appropriate and acceptable foods to be promote during the intervention is critical to the success of this project to select the food items that we will promote in the intervention study staff observed inventory at local wholesalers to identify availability of healthy and affordable beverages snacks and grocery items four child focus groups were conducted at baltimore city recreation centers children were involved in the selection of foods for promotion and in communication material pre testing to gauge which images characters slogans and messaging resonated three additional focus groups were conducted with adult caregivers to discuss media preferences for information dissemination information needs and to ascertain interest in cooking classes during the final two groups parents were asked to provide feedback on draft text messages and to discuss how frequently they would like to receive the text messages participants and recruitment the target group in the bhck multi level intervention are low income african american adolescents ages 10 14 and their adult caregivers recruitment will occur at recreation centers and neighborhoods sites within each zone interested parents guardians and youth are screened for eligibility prior to enrollment once a sample of 75 youth are screened as eligible in each of the hezs a sampling frame will be created for that hez among those recruited and screened 24 dyads comprised of a child and adult pair will be randomly selected in each neighborhood if a randomly selected dyad was unable to complete the interview then the next eligible dyad will be chosen from the recruitment list intervention the bhck intervention will involve multiple components at many levels figure 1 policy wholesalers recreation centers corner stores carryouts and family parents each component of the bhck program will reinforce several other components either by improving
 access or increasing demand policy level approaches the policy level intervention component will bridge the gap between research and policy by engaging with and informing key baltimore city stakeholders the policy work will strive to develop collaborations to sustain bhck program elements and to contribute to policy to improve the food environment a working group of nearly forty members was established in july 2013 with representation from the baltimore city health department city council department of planning school food services non profit organizations and academia quarterly meetings and cross sector communications with collaborators ensure engagement a key role of jhu will be the provision and development of the evidence base to support decision making and policy development by these entities unique to this component will be the use of computational modeling to simulate the potential impact of programs and policies for reducing children s obesity risk using agent based modeling 33 we have developed a virtual representation how low income baltimore children behave in their food environment including dietary and physical activity choices key institutions within this model corner stores carryouts recreation centers can be impacted by different intervention strategies the model will serve three major purposes as 1 a novel tool to better understand the dynamic nature of children and their food environment 2 a low cost approach to predict the impact of obesity prevention programs and policies before investing in implementation and 3 a highly visual interactive and intuitive platform to facilitate the exchange of ideas with policymakers the model will be presented at regular meetings to solicit feedback and promote dialogue about programs and policies of interest to stakeholders activities of the workgroup including the number of attendees per meeting the number of divisions represented at each meeting suggested updates to the model by stakeholders requests to simulate program or policy impact by stakeholders etc will be tracked to measure progress of this intervention component table 1 table 1 selected process evaluation measures

bhck s social media websites 50 posts week on 1 social media websites 1 goal setting messages week 1 wholesaler engagement and pricing strategies our work with wholesalers will aim to increase access to healthier foods by small retail and prepared food sources in the city by increasing the stocking and sales of affordable healthy food options at local wholesalers that supply corner stores and carryouts bhck will collaborate with two local wholesale distributors and a national club store these organizations have agreed to stock at least one type brand of the promoted food items for each sub phase of the program and to allow us to post the bhck logo sign on the shelves above or adjacent to the promoted products bhck staff will visit these locations once per month to assess the stocking of promoted foods and to ensure that logo signs remain posted correctly small store retailers often pay higher prices for low demand healthy foods than larger retailers due to their lower inventory participating wholesalers have agreed to provide discounts on select bhck promoted food items to participating small food sources we will also provide storeowners with gift cards from these businesses to use to purchase an initial stock of the promoted items expected benefits to participating wholesalers include increased sales potential new customers and public recognition for their support of the project recreation center activities and work with peer leaders the bhck study has used a participatory process with community partners and young people from intervention neighborhoods to develop the youth leader intervention including the youth leader training materials a curriculum that will be delivered to recreation center youth and messaging and promotional media videos posters for youth in the 10 14 year old age range youth leaders are seen as a reliable relatable and credible source of information 34 we will train a cohort of 16 youth leaders local college students ages 18 22 years to deliver a nutrition intervention to the target population of youth in the recreation centers in each intervention neighborhood youth leaders who successfully complete the training program will go on to deliver the curriculum to youth in the recreation centers the recreation center sessions will involve a brief instructional period 5 15 minutes of information giving followed by interactive games activities taste tests and cooking classes to reinforce promotional messages these sessions will be delivered by the youth leaders bi weekly with the support of project staff the topics activities and taste tests that occur in the recreation centers will mirror the topics and foods beverages promoted in the store intervention additionally the youth leaders roles will extend beyond the recreation centers and will cut across the intervention components as they will also be involved in delivering the intervention components in stores via promotional materials and on social media the youth leaders will partner with bhck staff to deliver interactive sessions in the corner stores they will serve as models or spokespeople for the program by having their images featured on promotional materials posters facebook posts tweets and will generate and promote by liking and sharing social media content for the intervention changing food access in corner stores carryouts at the food sources level bhck will aim to increase access to and demand for healthier food options a minimum of three food sources at least two corner stores and one carryout will be recruited from each zone located within a  mile radius of the recreation center the intervention components at the store level are based on previous corner store 35 39 and carryout 40 42 trials completed in baltimore city with additional innovative pieces at the small food source level bhck will begin with a series of storeowner trainings which aim to improve their knowledge of healthier food options and self efficacy to be able to stock prepare and sell their foods these trainings will be developed based on formative research 40 43 and will address the following topics 1 introduction to b more healthy communities for kids 2 customer service strategies for success 3 how to keep your food safe fresh and healthy 4 business strategies for success how to stock healthier foods 5 how to get wic in your store and 6 improving your store environment following completion of the trainings store owners may choose structural incentives to aid in the stocking of healthier food items i e a banana holder grill or small produce refrigerator after completion of the training phase the food promotion phases will begin which include smart beverages smart snacks and smarter cooking methods during each phase corner storeowners will be asked to stock at least four new healthy food options at the carryouts store owners will be asked to make the default beverage option a healthier option i e water with meal instead of soda provide healthier side dishes engage in healthier cooking methods such as grilling and create a healthy combo meal on their menu in order to create demand for these foods and improve customers knowledge about the foods a messaging campaign which was tested in focus groups with adults and children will be implemented through posters improved menu boards shelf talkers labels and other signage interactive sessions such as taste tests or blind tasting challenges will occur in each store at least every other week if stores successfully stock new healthy food options and allow the bhck team to promote the foods with their stores throughout the phases the bhck team will progressively deem each store a bronze silver gold or platinum certified healthy store family level work and text messaging adult caregivers will receive bi directional text messages textit inc 44 and have the option to select from one of two frequencies of text message delivery twice a week or three to five times a week the campaign content will be modified over the course of the intervention and will be tailored to each neighborhood the first message each week will encourage completion of an attainable and specific goal for example does ur child have a sweet tooth try offering them granola bars or fruit as an alternative to candy 1 time this week the subsequent text messages will offer support to help parents reach the goal by highlighting discounts offered on promoted products at local stores or bhck related activities social media websites such as facebook twitter and instagram will mirror the content of the text messages images will be added to the websites and interaction between parents will be encouraged participants will be asked to share whether they were able to achieve weekly goals
 and advise other parents the websites will also be used to link caregivers to outside resources available through other organizations i e farmers markets that accept supplemental nutrition program assistance benefits cooking classes offered for adults through the american heart association standards for intervention delivery intervention implementation at each level will be monitored through ongoing process evaluation with the intent to assure that set standards are being met table 1 these standards are based on our review of the literature and on our previous experience with wholesaler corner stores carryout and peer led interventions comparison group delayed intervention the comparison areas will receive an abbreviated version of the bhck intervention following completion of the

contains questions pertaining to household size and composition and use of community recreation centers by children specific food sources visited for purchasing getting foods and amount of money spent at each source is recalled for the last 30 days frequency of purchase of 40 non prepared foods in the last 30 days is recalled fruits vegetables chips soda chicken etc the next section asks how many times a meal was prepared for the household in the last 30 days and inquires about the top three most common preparation methods of seven types of foods chicken fish potatoes etc a series of self efficacy questions assess confidence in performing healthier behaviors along a 4 point ordinal scale eight questions about behavioral intentions about food are asked i e the next time you fried an egg what would you use to fry it a cooking spray b oil c butter margarine shortening or lard ten food related knowledge questions are asked the next section asks a series of questions about health beliefs and attitudes using a likert scale i e health foods are tasteless do you strongly disagree disagree undecided agree or strongly agree adult respondents are questioned about their food assistance participation and are asked to provide basic socioeconomic information education level income category the last section of the survey contains the 18 question usda food security questionnaire 45 the child interview consists of two instruments the block kids 2004 food frequency questionnaire ffq and a child impact questionnaire ciq the block kids 2004 ffq instrument is a validated ffq nutrition quest berkeley ca that asks about frequency and portion of consumption of 77 food items as is based on nhanes 1998 2002 data 46 the ciq consists of 79 questions pertaining to demographics food purchasing food preparation intentions about food outcome expectancies self efficacy food knowledge social support and breakfast consumption demographics including age birthdate sex race and contact information are obtained specific food sources visited number of times patronized and who the child most frequently shopped within the last seven days is recalled frequency and location of purchase of 65 non prepared and prepared food items is recalled for the last seven days beverages fruits and vegetables groceries fast food snacks etc the next section of the questionnaire assesses how often a member of the household prepared food for the child and how often the child prepared food for themselves in the last seven days if a child prepared food for themselves information on types of food prepared and methods of preparation utilized are collected twelve questions about behavioral intentions about food are asked i e if you wanted a snack which would you choose a potato chips b pretzels c yogurt eleven questions on both short term and long term outcome expectancies related to consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods are asked i e i would be healthier if i ate french fries three times a week instead of eating french fries seven days a week is this a true b mostly true c mostly false or d false a series of twelve self efficacy questions assess confidence in performing healthier behaviors along a 4 point ordinal scale fourteen food related knowledge questions are asked the survey contains two social support scales the first scale consists of seven questions that inquire whether the child has someone in their life that would support healthier food and physical activity habits who that person is and whether they are older younger or around the same age as the child the second social support scale consists of fourteen questions and asks how often the child s parents and peers exhibit certain behaviors that support healthy and unhealthy eating using a likert scale the final section assesses frequency of breakfast consumption and includes a 24 hour recall of breakfast consumed the previous day anthropometric data height and weight are collected from both the caregiver and the child using a seca 213 portable measuring rod stadiometer and a tantia bf697w duo scale at the store level sales data will be collected in two ways before during and after the intervention a bhck staff member will ask store owners approximately monthly to recall sales of selected food items promoted and non promoted foods in the last 7 days additionally some of the wholesalers with which we partner will provide the bhck team with specific sales data from accounts stores throughout the intervention wholesalers have agreed to provide sales data on promoted foods for bhck participating corner stores and carryouts sample size and statistical methods we used baseline data from our previous trial baltimore healthy stores regarding adult food purchasing to calculate sample size and study power to address the second hypothesis based upon our sample size calculations we will need to have a sample size of 720 adult caretaker child dyads this is equivalent to 24 dyads from each hez for the intervention assessments assuming a 15 20 drop out after two years this will leave us with a minimum of 600 adult caretaker child dyad respondents post intervention we will be able to detect a 4 6 point change in our frequency of healthy food purchasing score reflecting one healthy food purchased once a week for children participants in the dyads sample size and power for program impact on children s diet was calculated using national data on low income urban aa youth diet within each selected household we will randomly sample one child in the 10 14 year age range assuming 600 child respondents post intervention we will be able to detect a 320 450 difference in caloric intake a difference of 12 15 g of fat intake and a difference of 1 1.5 percentage points in percent of energy from fat discussion to our knowledge bhck will be one of few multi level multi component obesity prevention intervention trials working with urban low income minority youth first bhck will be a unique trial that seeks to integrate stakeholders at multiple critical levels policy food supply wholesalers retail corner stores carryouts community recreation centers and individual children and caregivers second policymakers and other key stakeholders will be engaged with the research in a novel manner using computational modeling our ability to simulate the potential impact of programs and policies within a virtual food environment will provide an approachable and low cost means to collaboratively explore ways to improve the food environment third multiple components of the food system will be targeted not only do storeowners receive business and nutrition training but the program intervenes at the wholesale level as well fourth there will be an emphasis on social aspects of the environment operating at the individual level including text messaging with caregivers and delivery of nutrition interventions through incorporation of youth leaders to allow for enhanced social modeling of desired eating behaviors this will be one of the first nutritionally related text messaging campaigns that will target low income participants and incorporate information regarding participants local food environment lastly detailed process and impact evaluations will occur at all intervention levels researchers public health officials and policy makers will have a significant
 interest in the results of the bhck intervention several leading organizations and scientists have cited that multi level multi component interventions are required to address the obesity epidemic in the us yet few of these large intervention trials have been successfully completed trials such as bhck are needed to support this claim one powerful advantage of bhck intervention will be that it will serve as a model of how to engage with city policymakers to improve the food environment because of its regular and prolonged engagement with policy makers the bhck intervention will have the potential to create long term impact and to be sustainable through institutionalization of intervention components with the largest impact into our partners in the baltimore city health department and

Q 1 introduction recent advances in the fields of material science and micro fabrication technology have facilitated the implementation of flexible multifunctional electronics for in vivo bio sensing applications in contrast to intrinsically rigid sensing devices based on microelectrode arrays such as the utah array 1 or neural probes 2 3 flexible sensors are able to deliver sufficient spatial density and a minimally invasive and non penetrating measurement interface furthermore the high bendability and or stretchability of these sensors make them ideal for tissue attachable applications as they can better adapt on skin and organ interfaces research in the field of flexible sensors has mainly concentrated on sophisticated skin or electronic skin e skin an electronic equivalent biological model that is realized by a large network of sensors on a stretchable substrate usually a layer of polyimide 2 25 m thick for detecting pressure 4 or temperature 5 other studies have introduced innovative approaches in diagnostic devices for medical surgery of cardiac or brain therapy viventi et al 6 employed a polyimide layer as the flexible structure substrate of a multilayered active circuitry which was able to conformally attach on the epicardial tissue by soft contact and record the voltage data of cardiac activation from 228 measurement points recently rodgers et al 7 implemented an inorganic electrode array on an ultrathin 2.5 m meshed polyimide substrate demonstrating the ability of the sensor to make conformal contact on the brain of a cat and spatially map the physiological signals in all aforementioned implementations polyimide has been chosen as the base substrate and insulating layer because of its high thermal and chemical resistance and mechanical robustness other studies have focused on other materials that are highly biocompatible transparent and compatible with conventional micro fabrication processes for example rodgers et al 8 fabricated high density electrode arrays on stand alone parylene ht films 13.5 16 m thick for neural stimulation and recording in retinal and spinal cord prosthetics because of parylene s chemical inertness the material has been used more than thirty years now to suppress the ph sensitivity of ion sensitive field effect transistors isfets and serve as a solid state reference electrode namely reference field effect transistor refet for differential isfet refet ph measurements the concept of the parylene gate fet pgfet has been introduced by matsuo et al 9 who deposited a thin 100 nm film of parylene on a si_3 n_4 gate isfet to make it chemically inert nonetheless the pgfet was ph sensitive demonstrating a maximum sensitivity of 28 mv ph below ph 4 whereas for larger ph values the sensor was ion insensitive chemical modification of parylene s surface with crown ether compounds was also implemented to examine the k_ sensitivity of the refet nevertheless problems such as decreasing ionic sensitivity response over time and large drift were reported fujihira and colleagues 10 attempted to enhance the encapsulation quality of parylene n in chemically sensitive fets chemfets by experimenting with different cleaning procedures and chemical treatments of si_3 n_4 before parylene deposition and also through esterification of the parylene s surface acids mostly carboxyl and hydroxyl groups they demonstrated a decrease of parylene s ph sensitivity to 4 mv per decade ph within the range of ph 4 10 and even lower outside this range nonetheless the stability of the parylene refet was highly subject to contamination and or surface chemical reactions which further compromised the accuracy of the isfet refet system other studies have exploited parylene s high biocompatibility and waterproofness to conformally coat implantable microdevices such as pacemakers 11 microelectrodes 12 and microelectromechanical devices for intraocular pressure monitoring 13 furthermore thanks to its excellent insulating properties parylene was used to package complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos based sensors in order to maintain leak signals at low levels 14 15 the material s excellent encapsulation properties have been attributed to its pinhole free nature above 1 m 16 but also to its hydrophobic surface that repulses any aqueous solution in addition to its numerous applications parylene s mechanical robustness facilitates highly bendable ultrathin membranes down to 1 m thickness that makes the material an ideal candidate for implantable sensors previously we have demonstrated that the h_ sensing capacity of parylene c can be activated through plasma oxidation 16 here we exploit this technology and present the application of parylene c in flexible electronics in a smart skin packaging we demonstrate a versatile method for producing flexible parylene c based ph sensors which employ the material both as a flexible structural support and as a functional material to capture and transmit chemical inputs the proposed work highlights a novel multifunctional approach for parylene c which can be employed in measuring multifunctional signals electrical and chemical in hybrid platforms 2 experimental section 2.1 sensor fabrication the fabrication process of the sensor is illustrated in figure 1a four inch si wafers were thoroughly cleaned with acetone ace isopropanol ipa and deionised di water and blown dry with nitrogen five m of parylene c were deposited on the wafers through chemical vapor deposition labcoater pds 2010 scs indianapolis in usa to form the flexible support substrate the wafers were spin coated with a thin layer 1.5 m of photoresist az5214e soft baked at 90 c for 1 min and then lithographically patterned electron gun deposition of pt 10 nm facilitated a 40 electrode array 30 m electrodes 200 m spacing on the parylene surface subsequently a 1 m thick parylene film was deposited on top of the array to serve as the sensing membrane access to the underlying pads was accomplished through a second lithography using a thick layer of photoresist 7 m of az4562 softbake at 100 c for 1 min and o_2 plasma etching nano uhp diener electronic gmbh nagold germany 400 w 31 min at a working pressure of 0.8 mbar finally the h_ sensing capacity of the array was activated through plasma oxidation 400 w 10 min at a working pressure of 0.8 mbar leaving a thin parylene film 200 nm on top of the electrode grid the parylene membrane was peeled off figure 1b fixed on a printed circuit board pcb based prototype with an epoxy resin and the pads were wire bonded to the pcb figure 1c to enable the monitoring of the chemical potentials because the adhesion between the encapsulation layer and the underlying material plays an important role for the efficiency of the encapsulation in our study we have chosen platinum to fabricate the miniaturized electrode array instead of other metals e g gold based on previous studies reporting that adhesion of parylene c is significantly stronger on pt substrates at similar deposition pressure 20 mtorr 17 furthermore it was also demonstrated that parylene to parylene adhesion was substantially high in agreement to this observation in our study we did not observe any adhesion issues as the deposition of parylene on top of an existing parylene c layer formed a well sealed sandwiched parylene structure parylene platinum parylene however to further improve the adhesion properties of parylene a pre treatment of the surface with an adhesion promoter for example silane a 174 can be employed 17 2.2 read out circuitry to evaluate the chemical performance of the sensing device the pcb prototype was remotely connected to the gates of discrete p type metal oxide semiconductor fets mosfets through an ffc fpc connector a universal instrumentation board was employed to host the inlet ports the mosfets a multiplexing scheme with the corresponding control pins the appropriate biasing circuitry consisting of dual operational amplifiers source drain followers and the outlet ports detailed description of the instrumentation board can be found in 18 the control pins of the multiplexors and the drain outputs were controlled by corresponding software in matlab_ via a data acquisition card ni usb6210 national instruments austin tx usa a simple schematic showing the architecture of the read out system is depicted in figure 2 the operational principle of these sensors is identical with isfets where the threshold voltage of the transducer varies in relation to the electrolyte ph clearly other circuitry can be used to deliver a more compact and responsive transducing system e g instrumentation amplifiers the extended gate protocol was employed in this study in order to separate the sensing part from the readout electronics and therefore increase the reliability and lifetime of the chemical sensors which is a key aspect for all implantable sensing applications depending on the h_ concentration in the solution the ions bind with the free bonds that are present on the plasma oxidized parylene membrane binding of the h_ in the vicinity of an electrode introduces a local capacitance at the corresponding gate of the mosfet which leads to a corresponding output drain voltage this in turn changes the threshold voltage of the mosfet allowing straightforward correlations between ph and output drain voltage 2.3 chemical experiments the chemical performance of the sensor was evaluated with 50 l drops of phosphate buffer solutions of known ph 7004 7007 7010 hanna instruments leighton buzzard uk a miniature ag agcl reference electrode was used as a remote gate and was immersed in the microdroplet during measurements each electrolyte solution was applied to the sensor for 3 min for the sensitivity experiments and for 1 h for the drift experiments in the following order ph 4 7 and 10 before testing a new electrolyte the sensors and the reference electrode
 were rinsed with di water to remove any residual chemical compounds and wiped carefully for the hysteresis experiments the sensor s output voltage was continuously recorded after applying electrolyte solutions in the following order ph 10 4 7 10 7 and 4 all experiments were carried out at room temperature inside a faraday cage to minimize noise 3 results and discussion 3.1 chemical sensitivity upon o_2 plasma oxygen is introduced on the surface of parylene c which is most likely attributed to the formation of chemical groups such as carbonyl c o carboxyl groups cooh or hydroxyl groups oh as demonstrated by previous studies 16 19 unlike parylene c which lacks binding sites oxidized parylene c is a chemically active surface able to capture h_ figure 3a thus bringing the chemistry closer to the sensing site figure 3b depicts the transient response output voltage of the dual operational amplifiers source drain followers of five sensing sites across three distinct electrolytes the sensor exhibits a linear response within the ph range 4 10 indicating a chemical sensitivity of 23 mv ph a linear relationship between voltage and ph value is important to extrapolate straightforward correlations between detected voltage and h_ concentrations as seen from figure 3b output voltage differs from channel to channel this is primarily attributed to the fabrication process i e deposition of parylene which introduces non uniformities over the entire set of sensing sites attributing non identical characteristics to the active transducers furthermore mobile ions in the electrolytes under test interact with the membrane surface and affect its chemical composition and thickness especially after long term use the minimum resolution of the sensor is 0.15 ph values and was determined through experiments within a ph range of 7 8 starting from a solution droplet of ph 7 and gradually increasing the ph of the droplet to determine the smallest ph change that the sensor is able to capture the measured sensitivity may appear relatively low compared to nernstian yet the relevant differences between the various ph values are well distinguishable the chemical sensitivity of the sensor depends on the oxygen plasma treatment which in turn defines the degree of the induced hydrophilicity and the residual membrane thickness 20 more profound oxidation of the parylene membrane increases the number of free oxygen based groups on the material s surface and thus the number of captured h_ additionally parylene is significantly etched under plasma oxidation yielding thinner sensing films on top of the electrode grid based on coulomb s electrostatic law thinner passivations account for an increased coupling of h_ 16 however the small electrode size of the sensor limits the achievable ph sensitivity due to the limited number of protons impinging on the surface moreover the substantially extended connection significantly increases the floating gate capacitance resulting in a voltage scaling which justifies the observed sensitivity 3.2 hysteresis figure 3c shows the results of hysteresis measurements for the flexible sensor in the loop of ph 10 4 7 10 7 and 4 oxidized parylene discloses a highly reactive behavior when it comes in contact with the solution for the first time as indicated by the response of the sensor during the first three experiments in figure 3c the material s sensing capability appears to stabilize yet from the second experimental cycle to evaluate the ability of the material to reproduce its response hysteresis was calculated as the percentage that the sensor s averaged output voltage deviates from its initial response under the same electrolyte solution table 1 the sensor exhibits small hysteresis voltage shift values of 5 mv ph 4 12 mv ph 7 whereas for ph 10 the hysteresis is larger 45 mv it is worth mentioning that the oxidized parylene c membrane tends to partially restore its induced hydrophilicity over time 20 which may also account for the observed deviations in the output response 3.3 electrical functionality the electrical functionality of the sensor was evaluated via an i_d v_gs sweep using a scs 4200 semiconductor characterization system keithley cleveland oh usa the mosfets gate voltage was swept from 1 to 0.5 v while the drain and source voltages were fixed at 0.5 and 0 v respectively the response of a single sensing site under electrolyte solutions of ph 4 7 and 10 is depicted in figure 3d the right axis of the figure demonstrates the corresponding measured leakage currents flowing through the ag agcl reference electrode measurements at a constant current 100 a corresponding to the operational region of the mosfets were used to assess the encapsulation integrity of the sensor table 1 similarly to isfets the gate leakage current here is a straightforward indication of the encapsulation degradation the leakage current in all cases remains at very low levels 1 14 na demonstrating the excellent encapsulation integrity of the sensor which can be further enhanced by using thicker capping films and selectively oxidizing parylene on top of the electrodes only while preserving the isolation of the electrode tracks with a thick hydrophobic film 16 3.4 chemical drift the long term stability of a sensor is particularly important especially when the sensor needs to reliably operate inside an aqueous environment for a substantial amount of time we evaluated the long term stability of the sensor in terms of the voltage drift v the main source of drift is the chemical interaction between the ions and the membrane which causes alterations on the surface uniformity the response of the flexible sensor was recorded for 1 h in a constant electrolyte environment 50 l ph 4 7 10 and average drift rates were extrapolated as the slope of the fitted lines v a be_ ct to the sensor s output excluding the first few minutes of transient response table 1 figure 3e depicts representative drift trends of a single sensing site 3.5 local ph detection local ph detection using the parylene based array was demonstrated through a diffusion experiment initially a microdroplet 50 l of ph 4 buffer solution was applied on the flexible platform a region consisting of a 3 3 electrode grid was continuously monitored while an equal volume of ph 7 buffer solution was added figure 4 illustrates the response uncalibrated data of the sensing array throughout this experiment as the solutions gradually mix and when the distinct ionic species within the two microdroplets are finally equally distributed 4 conclusions in this paper we have developed flexible parylene based high density electrode arrays for functional monitoring of ph current applications for implantable devices based on parylene c exploit the material either as an ion blocking layer or as a flexible support substrate here we present an integrated and multifunctional approach to use parylene both as a flexible support medium and as an active ph sensitive membrane within a single platform the sensing arrays are microfabricated according to a simple sandwich structure of hydrophobic parylene metal hydrophilic parylene the sensing platforms have been characterized via discrete mosfets experimental results indicate that the proposed platform can reliably map the local ph levels with a chemical sensitivity of 23 mv ph while it preserves a good encapsulation quality and small drift after a long term use our approach can be exploited to establish hybrid flexible sensing platforms that will facilitate concurrent electrical and chemical recordings this can yield a plethora of applications ranging from epidermal electronics bio tattoos to implantable ultrathin

Q background dental caries is the most common of all chronic diseases in industrial and in most lower income countries oral conditions affected 3.9 billion people and untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent condition evaluated for the entire global burden of disease gbd 2010 study with a global prevalence of 35 for all ages combined 1 although the prevalence and severity of dental caries have decreased substantially in the past two decades this largely preventable disease is still common increases significantly with age and remains a public health problem sugars are recognised as by far the most important dietary factor in the development of dental caries and there is a clear understanding of the biology of the process of enamel dissolution induced by acid fermented products of sugars by the action of bacteria 2 a variety of factors modify this effect they include saliva the frequency of sugar intakes the individual tooth chosen for examination as well as the post eruptive age of the tooth and whether long standing fluoride use has changed the enamel to make it more resistant to acid attack 3 despite the use of fluoride and improvements in preventive dentistry the burden of dental caries remains unacceptably high worldwide particularly when in addition to the traditional focus on childhood caries the caries burden in adults is considered given the acceptance that sugar intake is the primary cause of dental caries with variations in the incidence and prevalence reflecting the impact of the above modifying factors the usual caveats relating potentially to unknown causes do not apply because there is no other mechanism for inducing caries so the only confounding factors i e tooth brushing and the use of fluoride in drinking water or toothpaste serve to reduce the magnitude of the simple relationship between sugar intake changes and caries incidence the most extensive systematic review of the relationship between caries and sugars was very recently conducted by moynihan and kelly 4 one of the objectives of their review was to update evidence on the association between amount of sugars intake and dental caries and on the effect of restricting sugars intake to 10 and 5 energy e on caries as 10 e is the current who guideline on sugar intake they searched the central register of controlled trials latin american and caribbean health sciences china national knowledge infrastructure and wanfang s african department of health data from 5990 papers they identified 55 studies that were eligible these were 3 intervention 8 cohort 20 population and 24 cross sectional studies forty two of the 50 studies in children and 5 5 studies in adults reported at least one positive association between some measure of daily total free or added sugars rather than between frequency of sugar consumption and caries moynihan and kelly 4 found that studies of caries rates when sugars intake was above or 10 e provided evidence of moderate quality in support of lower sugars using the new grade system which relies heavily on double blind trials even when dealing with public health issues relating to population diets when considering the lower cut off 5 e a significant relationship was observed but the evidence was judged to be of very low quality because it was based on detailed observational studies in cohorts undergoing major national dietary change and not involving a defined randomized intervention group within the society concerned given that the recent systematic review by moynihan and kelly 4 showed a clear relation between sugars and caries another systematic review of this issue is not warranted however no analysis has yet been made of the lifetime burden of caries induced by sugar to see whether the who goal of 10 level is optimum and compatible with low levels of caries given therefore the renewed interest in the optimum intake for sugar intake now that dietary sugars have been shown to help induce excess weight gain and obesity 5 this paper re examines the quantitative relationship between sugar intake and the development and the life long burden of dental caries methods primary information was first obtained from nationally representative prevalence and incidence data on caries these assessments also contained sugar intakes specified either by dietary surveys or by the national intake assessed from the un food and agriculture organizations food balance sheet data 6 were derived in a standard way from industrial and other criteria specified by national governments in addition personal contacts with international scholars familiar with national data published either as governmental reports or in other formats were obtained and translated for example we analyzed data from japanese reports on national annual examination data of school children based on nationwide sample surveys published by ministry of education and some local surveys kindly provided by colleagues from these sources we selected data providing data on assessments of non milk extrinsic sugars intakes from dietary questionnaires or from national data on the annual sugar availability or dietary intake sugars in this international context relate to national statistics for sucrose availability but in the us fructose syrups are included and in the uk the term non milk extrinsic sugars is used to define these non lactose disaccharides with maltose making a negligible contribution it is well recognized biologically that the monosaccharides fructose plus glucose in combination can also cause caries but in practice most of the statistics in these re analyses relate to sucrose intake or that available for consumption intakes refer to sugars specifically available for consumption after correction for waste and other non food uses of sugar the statistics do not take account of sugars contained in dried fruit these intakes refer to absolute intakes and not to the frequency of sugar intake during the day sugar intakes specified in kg head yr were expressed in energy by taking the energy as 4 kcal g for sugar and a global national average energy intake including children of 2 000 kcal head day particular attention was paid to countries with sugar intakes of 15 energy or 27.5 kg per annum and then those where detailed examination of the caries prevalence were also monitored countries where sugar intakes were previously very low or had changed due to rationing in wartime or under sanctions were included studies fulfilling those criteria were tristan de cunha 7 nigeria 8 germany 9 channel islands 10 norway 11 iraq 12 and japan 13 a re assessment was carried out of the dose response relation between dietary sugar and caries incidence in teeth with different levels of susceptibility to dental caries in japanese children 14 together with an assessment of the extent of continuing caries in adult life the quantitative impact of fluoride on the prevalence and severity of caries was also then assessed three countries ireland australia and the united states where water fluoridation had been implemented for over 30 years were selected on the basis that they had a legal requirement for universal water fluoridation as well as the usual use of fluoride toothpastes 15 17 because a comprehensive systematic review using similar methods has just been published 4 the analogous findings of a proportionally greater caries experience with greater sugar intakes with rising sugar intakes are not reported here we assess the importance of differential tooth susceptibility to caries the postponement of caries incidence by fluoride and the burden of caries on a life time basis results secular changes in sugar intake and dental caries national analyses from low income countries show that dental caries was very uncommon before people starting consuming refined sugars thus caries was rare in tristan de cunhan in all ages when in 1938 average sugar intakes were only 1.8 g day or 0.4 of average energy intake e per person caries affected 2 of 13 to 19 yr old adolescents and 7 of adults aged 30 39 years however by the 1960s sugar intake was 150 g per day 30 e and 17 5 of children already had caries 7 similarly sheiham reported that only 2 of urban and rural nigerians of all ages including the elderly whose permanent teeth had been exposed to diets for half a century had any dental caries when their sugar intakes were about 2 g day per person 0.4 e 8 thus sheiham s study indicates that with very low intakes of sugars caries rarely occurs at any age two cross sectional surveys indicate that there is a strong positive correlation ranging from 0 72 to 0 95 between sugar consumption and dmft 9 13 wartime analyses amplify the close correlation between sugar availability and the prevalence and severity of dental caries as seen in norway 11 and in europe generally during and after world war ii and more recently in iraq during the un sanctions 12 the most comprehensive national data are from takeuchi in japan where before during and after world war ii per capita sugars levels decreased from 15 kg per year 8 2 e to 0 2 kg 0 1 e and then increased again to 15 kg per year over a period of 11 years thereby allowing analysis of the impact of sugar on caries cavitation 13 in the studies each tooth was examined separately at yearly intervals in each individual and showed a clear relationship between the average prevailing sugar intake levels and dental caries that had progressed to cavitation dose response relationships the dose response relationship between sugars and caries is only sigmoid as previously suggested if one chooses the most resistant incisor teeth and considers only the first year of exposure to sugar as shown in figure 1 14 when however the more caries susceptible molar teeth are assessed and exposure to sugars for 7 8 years is considered then the relationship becomes log linear or in arithmetic terms curvilinear
 figure 2 even though the diagnostic level of caries used was cavitation a late stage of caries 18 there is no evident threshold for sugars but a log linear increase in caries rates between 1 kg sugar head yr 0.05 e and 5 7 5 kg sugar head yr 2 7 4 1 e if teeth that have been erupted for 7 8 years are considered 14 18 19 the positive correlation between sugars and caries was 0 7 with a log linear relation at both lower and higher sugar intake levels for all tooth types if 1 8 years of sugar exposure is considered 13 14 18 19 the relationship holds for both increases and decreases in sugars consumption which limits the possibility of confounders affecting that relationship from almost zero intakes on a population basis with probably modest individual variation in sugar intake an increase from about zero sugar intake to an average of 5 kg yr 2 7 e leads to at least a doubling in the prevalence rate of caries in molars 8 years after tooth eruption figure 1 figure 1 three dimensional model of the cumulative numbers of caries in upper central incisor teeth data were plotted on a log scale by post eruptive tooth age up to 8 years and related to the average annual sugar consumption per head in japan from 1935 to 1957 takeuchi et al 14 with permission figure 2 relationship between annual per capita sugar consumption and annual caries incidence in lower first molar teeth data based on 10 553 japanese children whose individual teeth were monitored yearly from the age of 6 to 11 years of age data plotted on a log scale adapted from koike 18 the impact of fluoride on the sugar caries relationship fluoride is associated with about 25 lower caries experience when sugar intakes are constant between 10 15 e in 12 year old children 20 the widescale use of fluoride toothpaste is a reasonable explanation for the decline in children s caries in many countries since the 1970s yet what then becomes relatively evident is that caries becomes more prominent in adolescents and adults 4 21 ireland has had a mandatory national water fluoridation policy since 1964 but some areas have not implemented the fluoridation policy thereby allowing a comparison within a country where fluoride toothpaste is in widespread use but drinking water fluoride varies additional benefits accrued from having fluoride in water as well as toothpastes but 7.3 of even the youngest adults aged 16 24 years with lifelong fluoride exposure still had dental caries experience in 4.6 teeth as did 53 of the 35 44 year olds assessed 35 years after the beginning of water fluoridation the mean dmft was 13.3 and 16.0 in those living in non fluoridated areas 15 australia has water fluoridation in a number of cities but despite fluoride use from both toothpastes and drinking water the mean dmft and df surfaces for all adults increased adults aged 65 years and older had ten times higher levels of caries than 15 24 year olds 16 thus although fluoride reduces caries unacceptably high levels of caries in adults persist in all countries even in those with widespread water fluoridation and the use of fluoridated toothpastes 21 national us data show that despite the widescale use of fluoridated toothpaste and consumption of fluoridated water by 66 of americans since the 1960s 92 of usa adults aged 20 to 64 have experienced dental caries in their permanent teeth and those aged 65 to 74 years have on average 70 decayed missing or filled surfaces dmfs of the possible surfaces at risk of caries in the permanent teeth figure 3 17 figure 3 the decayed missing and filled teeth dmft and filled tooth surfaces dmfs in a national usa sample showing that the numbers of dmfs was over 70 by 75 years adapted from dye et al 17 the majority of caries in permanent teeth occurs in adults not in children that is evident in countries with low as well as high sugar intakes irrespective of the fluoride intakes 15 17 21 25 thus in china the mean dmft was 0.5 in 12 year olds 4.0 when 35 44 years and 14.6 in 65 74 year olds when the average sugar intake was 6 4 kg person year 3 5 e in 2005 albeit with well known intake differences between urban and rural areas 24 in south korea with sugar intakes between 7 3 g day 1 5 e in 1998 and 10 5 g day 2 1 e in 2011 the dmft in 12 year olds was 2 0 and in 35 44 year olds 5 2 in 2011 only 3 2 surfaces were affected in 12 year olds but 14 3 were carious in 35 44 year olds and 39 surfaces out of a total 160 by 65 74 years 25 these data emphasise the importance of considering the adult burden when assessing optimum intakes of sugar discussion that dietary sugar causes caries is rarely disputed although some academic dentists emphasise the importance of the frequency of sugar consumption and the adverse effects of sugary drinks and confectionery rather than sugary foods each of these factors enhances the short term induction of caries 2 nevertheless studies which simply deal with sugar intakes predominantly in food as seen in such unusual settings as the island of tristan de cunha reveal that added sugar even within food induces dental caries good preventive dental care and the use of fluoridated toothpastes preferably with fluoridated water supplies to cover the needs of those who do not practice careful personalised preventive measures is also claimed to be adequate without the need to consider lowering sugar intakes however the increasing caries levels as people progress through the life course 26 shows that the major caries burden is in adults although good preventive dental care and the use of fluoride do reduce caries 20 the nature of the dose response relationship of caries development to sugar intakes the sugar caries relationship is log linear or in arithmetic terms curvilinear originally we proposed that the dose response relationship corresponded to a sigmoid curve since the takeuchi data showed low levels of dental caries in upper incisor teeth at sugar intakes below 10 kg year 5 5 e 13 27 greater sugar intakes induced marked increases in new caries lesions and the upper flat part of the curve seemed to reflect a maximum rate of tooth decay implying a sigmoidal response to sugar intakes this was mistaken for five reasons first we had as a very conservative approach used the least susceptible teeth the incisors for assessing threshold sugar intakes clearly from a disease burden point of view the susceptibility of all teeth is important second we followed the traditional and still almost routine approach to dental surveys and analyses by focussing on tooth decay in children because the emphasis has always been on the need for children to be treated third we arbitrarily chose caries occurring within a year of eruption as a good sensitive index which could readily be related to the prevailing sugar intakes when in practice it was already evident that even incisor teeth which were caries free one year post eruption did indeed develop caries as exposure to sugar continued the spurious concept of a plateau developed simply because it was not possible to document cavitation the late stage of sugar induced enamel dissolution within the year even if there were higher levels of sugar intake furthermore by choosing this time frame the overall burden of caries even in children was markedly underestimated then we failed to take account of the fact that although the age specific rates of caries are lower with the use of fluoride fluoride use merely delayed the ultimate onset of caries so that adolescents and adults were then the age groups displaying the caries burden finally we were slow to realise that the apparent plateau in caries development at higher sugar intakes simply meant that sugar intakes were so high that all tooth surfaces were approaching their sugar saturation level the sugar caries relationship in adults has been largely ignored all the conclusions on safe levels of sugar and the relationship between sugar and caries are based on children s data with fluoride and greater dental care caries has declined in children so some dental authorities have concluded that sugars are not a major determinant of caries provided fluoride toothpaste is use diligently with or without water fluoridation however it is now evident that the majority of caries occurs in adults not in children because the disease is cumulative and the rates of caries in individuals tracks from early childhood to adolescence and then into adulthood 21 26 so the conclusion that sugar is not the major determinant of caries is simply wrong the chronic cumulative impact of caries arising from the continuing availability of susceptible teeth and natural teeth surfaces to long term sugar exposure is vividly shown by a dunedin new zealand longitudinal study where a comprehensive free school based dental service for children failed to prevent the progressive increase in caries although the rate varied dramatically between individuals followed from 5 years of age for the next 27 years 26 although it could be argued that those showing a very small increase in caries burden may have been particularly attentive to preventive measures after leaving school yet on a population basis there is already a marked burden of disease in early adulthood the data from the us sweden and japan 17 22 23 show that the major burden of sugar induced caries increases markedly after 32 years of age 21 the economic burden of adult caries caries impacts seriously on individuals and society in terms of pain discomfort social and functional limitation and handicap so the effect on the quality of life is considerable 28 the who estimates that oral diseases are the fourth most expensive diseases to treat in most industrialized countries 29 in some countries such as germany and japan dental care accounts for a higher percentage of health expenditure than most if not all other diseases for most ages dental diseases ranked second to cancer in
 terms of cost 30 treatment of caries in low income countries by traditional restorative dentistry for the permanent dentition costs us 1 618 $3 513 per 1000 children aged 6 18 years so the cumulative cost of treating caries in children alone exceeds the financial resources available for all health care for children in the majority of poor nations 31 an optimum intake of sugars since the first millennium analysis of the global burden of disease who s approach is to set the minimum average population level of a risk factor that minimizes a disease 32 thus 115 mmhg has been the optimum average population systolic blood level and 3.8 mmol l the optimum total cholesterol level this approach also led who to propose an intake of 5 g salt d taking this approach would probably mean setting the ideal goal of free non milk extrinsic sugars intake at 0 certainly as set out in the original analyses by who 33 there is no intrinsic biological need for sugar intakes as noted when those with fructose intolerance eliminate sugar intakes even in children a doubling in the burden of caries is evident on sugar intakes of 5 e and the relatively new data from adult caries burdens in relation to sugar intakes in japan and china suggest that 3 e sugar intake is appropriate so even given the use of fluoridated water and fluoride enriched toothpastes sugar intakes of no more than 5 e should be considered as a maximum levels above that will cause substantial caries burdens even with the extensive use of fluoride our findings support those of moynihan and kelly 4 whose findings from their systematic review suggest that there may be benefit in limiting sugars to 5 e to minimize risk of dental caries throughout the life course the who originally accepted sreebny s proposition that 50 g d intake was acceptable when the dmft in 12 year old children was below 3 34 with the then high level of dental caries in children in affluent societies in the 1970s who considered a goal of a mean dmft of 3 by the year 2000 for dental health in 12 year olds as a reasonable target thus the concept of 50 g a day as a safe level seems to have been the basis for several countries and who to consider a 10 e sugar intake acceptable 33 the acceptability of a daily 50 g sucrose intake seemed to be reinforced by finding an increase in cavitation rates in less susceptible teeth erupted for only a year in 6 12 year olds when sugar intakes reached nearly 10 e that is 50 g d 35 the findings from this study indicate that current approaches to controlling dental caries are failing to prevent high levels of caries in adults in all countries and this relates to the current high level of sugar intake across the globe thus for multiple reasons including obesity and diabetes prevention we need to adopt a new and radical policy of progressive sugar reduction this is particularly appropriate given the concerns of the united nations environment programme about mercury in dental amalgams and the need to phase down using amalgam this means that it is now even more important to develop a radical prevention policy with a marked reduction in sugar intake since the use of fluoride on its own is insufficient to reduce substantially the burden of caries over the lifetime of individuals strengths and limitations of this study the strengths of the study include our finding that on re evaluating the dose response relationship between sugar and caries we found that the sugar caries relationship is in arithmetic terms curvilinear and not sigmoidal and is evident at average sugar intakes well below 10 e extensive searches of the historical as well as current literature on sugars and caries were carried out the limitations of the study related to the absence of defined valid data on the dose response relationship of adult caries when sugar intakes change therefore our findings depend on data from children together with longitudinal data on an annual basis into the fourth decade of life however they are reinforced by the findings of the heavy burden of dental caries in adults evident despite the widescale uses of fluorides so caries progressively increases with age when sugar intake levels are those commonly consumed throughout the world article summary double blind intervention trials as well as detailed biochemical and clinical studies prove that sugar intake is the major cause of dental caries whether in food or drink the applicability of intervention trials to national policies is best judged by assessing the response in the population burden of caries to changes in national diets with confirmation from observations of caries prevalence in different national settings where sugar fluoride intakes are known new analyses show that the life long burden of caries increases as sugar intakes increase from 0 e the progressive accumulation of dental caries despite widespread use of fluoride shows that sugar intakes should be 3 energy to minimize the disability and cost of dental caries in a population a 5 e sugar intake should be considered as a maximum even with the use of fluoridated water and fluoride toothpaste conclusions there is a robust log linear relationship of caries to sugar intakes from 0 e to 10 e sugar a 10 e sugar intake induces a costly burden of caries these findings imply that public health goals need to set sugar intakes ideally 3 e with 5 e as a pragmatic goal even when fluoride is widely used adult as well as children s caries burdens should define the new criteria for developing goals for sugar intake competing interests there are no competing interests authors contributions as undertook a series of searches for national data contacted japanese colleagues for original japanese papers and arranged their

Q 1 introduction allergic and irritant contact dermatitis are the most common eczematous diseases an early response of keratinocytes which constitute the major epidermal cells of the skin involves a non immunological reaction that is characterized by cell damage induced by reactive oxygen species ros ros can promote the release of pro inflammatory cytokines from keratinocytes which in turn activate an immunological response that leads to the progress of contact dermatitis 1 2 there are several sources of ros in the cell the most notable resulting from alterations in the activities of nadph oxidase xanthine oxidase and the mitochondrial respiratory cycle if chemicals interfere with the activities of these enzyme systems oxidative stress will be rapidly elevated evaluation of the cell damaging effects of compounds including oxidative stress can be conducted by cell based sensor systems which are capable of adapting the process of skin irritation by integrated in vitro models and enabling a predictive as well as descriptive prescreening moreover they may represent a sufficient alternative to the three common ways of measuring the presence of oxidative stress which are the direct measurement of ros the determination of the ros evoked damage to biomolecules and the detection of antioxidant levels their spectra have been intensively reviewed 3 direct detection is hampered by its extreme instability of ros therefore it is preferred to measure the ros induced damage to proteins dna rna lipids or other biomolecules by adapting thiobarbituric acid tba or comet assays among others while these are indirect methods many markers of damage are extremely stable and therefore provide a more reliable scheme of measuring oxidative stress another approach is to quantify the levels of antioxidant enzymes and other redox molecules that serve to counterbalance ros generated in the cell assays are available to measure the activity of specific antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase or the determination of redox sensitive systems such as thioredoxin or glutathione 4 the latter exists in two forms including the reduced sulfhydryl form gsh and the oxidized disulfide gssg the main function of gsh is to neutralize ros using mechanisms involving glutathione peroxidase glutathione s transferase and glutathione reductase interestingly glutathione concentrations are significantly increased in hacat cells following exposure to the toxic metal cadmium 5 6 although the mechanisms of cadmium toxicity are cell type dependent this metal is known to induce the expression of cysteine rich metal binding proteins metallothioneins that can protect the cell from cadmium toxicity and inactivate antioxidant enzymes by interacting with the thiol groups of these proteins resulting in the generation of ros in addition cadmium provokes homeostatic alterations in physiological metals such as copper zinc and iron and increases the transcript levels of enzymes that are involved in glutathione biosynthesis including gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase cadmium severely affects the redox status of cells even at sub lethal concentrations and induces oxidative stress in hacat cells as demonstrated by decreased gsh gssg ratios 5 7 the human skin is permanently exposed to stress factors such as ultraviolet light and xenobiotics which may result in the generation of ros as such keratinocytes are actively involved in the immune reactions that are characteristic of contact dermatitis for example by producing cytokines therefore keratinocytes represent a valuable model cell type for the screening of the dermatological effects of skin damaging agents in this study a simple and fast detection of the oxidative stress response in keratinocytes is described using genetically modified sensor cells that are based on the human adult low calcium high temperature hacat cell line 8 which was stably transfected with a reporter construct that allowed for the expression of green fluorescent protein gfp under the control of the promoter regulating the human heat shock protein hsp70b the resulting optical sensor cell line demonstrated time and dose dependent activities when chemicals or plant extracts that are known skin irritants were used we compare our results to conventional measurements of total glutathione tgsh concentrations in hacat cells and highlight the advantages of using a live cell based biosensor instead furthermore we discuss insights into the varying effects of xenobiotics on non immunological skin cells thereby contributing to the understanding of keratinocyte participation in the development of different forms of contact dermatitis based on our recent study that established hsp72 as a biomarker for the indirect determination of oxidative stress in cultured human keratinocytes 9 we evaluated here whether the properties of this keratinocyte sensor cell line could be improved for future applications in micro total analysis systems tas by replacing the hsp72 promoter with that of hsp70b 2 experimental section 2.1 cell culturing and cytotoxicity testing the cultivation of hacat cells 8 and determination of cell viability using the 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt cytotoxicity assay were performed as described previously 9

sulfate niso_4 6h_2 o and cadmium chloride cdcl_2 were dissolved in deionized distilled water 2.2 determination of gene expression levels the isolation of total rna from the hacat cells and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr were essentially performed as described 9 the primer sequences for qrt pcr were as follows hspa6 fwd 5 tgc aag agg aaa gcc tta ggg

in 70 ethanol v v at 60 c for 36 h the solvent was evaporated to dryness after first being reduced using a vacuum rotary evaporator at 60 c for the cell culture experiments the dry extracts drug extract ratio of 7.3 1 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for the quantitative analysis sample preparations were conducted according to the previously described method 10 with an amount of extract that was equivalent to 1 g of dried plant material using santonin as an internal standard the analysis was conducted using the agilent gc ms system gc 7890a msd 5975c gerstel gmbh co kg mhlheim an der

increased from 100 c to 300 c at 10 c min and held at 300 c for 40 min the injector temperature was 250 c and the injection volume was 1 l the carrier gas flow was 1.6 ml min with a 1 10 splitting

achieved using turbofect thermo fisher scientific schwerte germany according to the manufacturer s protocol and a subsequent selection in medium containing 1 mg ml g418 resistant cells were harvested and initially screened using fluorescence activated cell sorting facs facsaria iiu becton dickinson heidelberg germany to eliminate cells with constitutively high gfp expression levels and no induction of the functional promoter negative screening cells demonstrating low basal gfp expression were tested for hsp70b induced gfp expression by incubation for 2 h at 43 c followed by a 12 16 h recovery at 37 c only cells responding to heat shock with high levels of gfp expression were collected for single clone selection positive screening hsp70b induced gfp expression following heat shock was confirmed in single clones by microscopy and facs to select a working cell line showing the strongest signal to noise ratio in response to heat shock 2 h 43 c and exposure to cdcl_2 6 h 25 m 9 2.5 quantitative fluorescence microscopy fluorescence microscopy was used for the quantitative assessment of cellular gfp expression levels in an incubation time and dose dependent manner the sensor cell line was seeded on coverslips at a density of 50 000 cells cm_2 in 24 well culture plates following treatment with toxins the cells were kept under normal culture conditions for up to 18 h gfp expression levels were observed using an axio imager m2 zeiss jena germany cell culture images showing confluent cell layers were digitally recorded with an axiocam mrm camera that was attached to the microscope using the filter set 38 he and a 20 objective zeiss jena germany the average fluorescence mean grey value of each cell region was corrected for medium and device fluorescence and compared to an untreated control to obtain relative fluorescence values 2.6 determination of total cellular glutathione concentrations of tgsh in cells were determined as described previously 12 two hundred thousand
 cells were seeded into each well of a 6 well plate following incubation with the toxins the cells were washed with pbs after harvesting 600 000 cells were resuspended in extraction buffer 0.1 triton x 100 and 0.6 5 sulfosalicylic acid in potassium phosphate buffer and underwent two cycles of freezing at 80 c and thawing the lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were mixed with 5 5 dithio bis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dntb 0.66 mg ml glutathione reductase 454 u ml and nadph 0.66 mg ml the chromophore product was immediately measured at 412 nm every 30 s for 3 min the tgsh concentration of the unknown sample was determined according to a regression curve of the gsh standard 3 results and discussions 3.1 hsp70b is a sensitive biomarker for the prediction of oxidative stress hsp70b was previously used as a biomarker for oxidative stress in diverse mammalian cell lines 13 15 building upon these observations we first tested whether hsp70b expression was also induced in response to stress in the human keratinocyte cell line hacat to this end hacat cells were exposed to either 25 m cdcl_2 or elevated culture temperatures 43 c which are both known to induce hsp72 promoter activity in hacat cells 9 the method of qrt pcr was used to determine the mrna levels of the hsp70b gene we found that its expression was low in untreated cells and was induced by approximately 335 fold in response to cdcl_2 exposure data not shown likewise 148 fold and 269 fold inductions in hsp70b gene expression were observed following heat treatment for 1 h and 2 h respectively the observation of a stronger induction from very low basal activity compared to hsp72 indicated that the generation of a sensitive sensor cell line based on a hsp70b driven reporter gene in hacat cells would be superior to the hsp72 gfp reporter in future tas settings to determine whether the induction of hsp70b expression in hacat cells in response to cdcl_2 exposure was in fact correlated with increased oxidative stress we determined tgsh concentrations in transfected cells oxidative stress can act in three different ways on the glutathione pool in hacat cells 6 first cdcl_2 may alter the ratio of the reduced sulfhydryl form of glutathione gsh to the oxidized glutathione disulfide gssg second cdcl_2 exposure affects the activities of enzymes that are involved in combatting ros such as superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase third treatment with cdcl_2 increases tgsh concentrations in the cells as shown in figure 1 a dose dependent increase in tgsh concentrations in hacat cells in response to a cdcl_2 challenge was observed the maximal increase in tgsh of approximately 1.7 fold was achieved following the treatment of cells with 25 45 m cdcl_2 for 6 h which was well below the range of general cdcl_2 cytotoxicity in hacat cells as determined by mtt assays following 24 h of exposure ec_50 45 7 m 9 the limit of detection lod of the applied tgsh assay was determined to be 1 m cdcl_2 following a 6 h incubation with the toxin a cdcl_2 induced increase in tgsh could be explained in principle by the oxidative stress induced activation of signaling pathways that led to an increase in the de novo production of enzymes that are involved in glutathione biosynthesis 16 17 to further evaluate the suitability of hsp70b induction as a predictor of oxidative stress induced cell damage in keratinocytes hsp70b gene expression was tested following the exposure of hacat cells to selected chemicals and a plant extract that was prepared from a montana flowers which are known skin irritants 18 concentrations of compounds were selected according to their general cytotoxicities to hacat cells according to ec_80 values as determined by mtt assays after 24 h of exposure data not shown we first determined in parallel the stress induced increase in hsp70b expression and the cellular tgsh content after challenging the cells with 10 m of dncb or 400 m of niso_4 for up to 8 h the response of cells to 25 m cdcl_2 served as a positive control figure 2 the experiments reproduced the 335 fold induction of hsp70b expression following cdcl_2 treatment that persisted over an 8 hour period likewise a nearly 2 fold increase in tgsh content was achieved in cells that were treated with cdcl_2 figure 2 an approximately 7.3 fold induction in hsp70b expression was observed following the exposure of cells to dncb for 3 h this response was not only much less pronounced compared with the cadmium induced effects but it also rapidly reverted to nearly normal levels after 6 8 h nevertheless dncb induced an approximately 1.5 fold increase in the cellular tgsh pool interestingly the treatment of cells with 400 m of niso_4 neither induced hsp70b expression nor did it enhance the cellular tgsh pool figure 2 this is consistent with the observation that niso_4 does not produce ros in a concentration range that is non toxic to hacat cells 2 in summary the data show that hsp70b is a suitable biomarker for chemicals that induce oxidative stress irrespective of whether they act as a skin irritant cdcl_2 or cause allergic contact dermatitis dncb in vivo dried flowers of a montana are used for the topical treatment of skin bruises contusions and pain despite its traditional anti inflammatory use 19 there have been several reports attributing dose dependent cytotoxic effects to the sesquiterpene lactone stl fraction of the a montana extract particularly helenalin 18 stl can cause contact dermatitis in two principal ways it can directly alkylate and inactivate proteins that are involved in the cell protective stress response given the millimolar concentration of glutathione in the cell stl rapidly form glutathione adducts which can also act as specific inhibitors of enzymes that are required for example to combat oxidative stress 20 21 we investigated the impact of the a montana extract and purified helenalin on hsp70b expression in hacat cells the qrt pcr measurements revealed a strong dose and time dependent increase in hsp70b mrna levels after the treatment of hacat cells with the a montana extract treating the cells with the ec_80 concentration of the a montana extract 125 g ml resulted in a 300 fold induction in hsp70b gene expression after 3 h of incubation figure 3 a quantitative analysis of the a montana extract that was used in this study revealed a concentration of 144.0 26.7 g ml or 530 m of helenalin considering that we applied the extract according to the ec_80 value of 125 g ml the final concentration of helenalin in the experiment was estimated to be 1.35 m pure helenalin was able to increase hsp70b mrna expression in a dose dependent manner with saturation at 7 m data not shown if applied at its ec_80 concentration of 5 m helenalin induced hsp70b mrna expression to similar levels as the a montana extract figure 3 the induction of hsp70b expression by helenalin is consistent with its reported stimulation of apoptosis by the generation of ros 22 the results suggest that helenalin is a major active component in the a montana extract with respect to the observed hsp70b induction but further components of the stl or flavonoid fractions may have additive or synergistic roles in a montana cytotoxicity in hacat cells it is worth noting that although its effect on hsp70b expression was similar to that which was observed following cdcl_2 treatment the tgsh concentrations of cells that were exposed to the a montana extract did not increase but rather declined by more than half of the level of untreated controls figure 3 likewise helenalin dramatically reduced the tgsh pool in the hacat cells although the effects on the cellular tgsh concentrations that were obtained using the a montana extract or helenalin seemed to conflict with the results that were observed following exposure to cadmium other studies have described the reduction of the cellular tgsh pool by stl including helenalin likely through the ros dependent oxidization of the cysteine pool that is required for glutathione synthesis 23 the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effects of cdcl_2 and helenalin on the cellular tgsh pool remain elusive however our observations may indicate that different gene regulatory pathways are activated by either compound irrespective of the fact that both are strong inducers of ros production whereas the toxic mechanisms of cadmium have been thoroughly described 6 7 24 the effects of contact allergens such as dncb and niso_4 on non immunological skin cells have been investigated only recently 2 although concentrations of compounds were applied that had comparable effects on cell viability ec_80 the incubation of hacat cells with cdcl_2 resulted in a much higher induction of hsp70b compared with the dncb treatment the toxic mechanisms of cadmium that affect cellular homeostasis are very complex and act indirectly by inhibiting antioxidant enzyme activities leading to increased ros levels 5 25 furthermore the heat shock factor hsf 1 has been identified as the mediator of stress induced heat shock gene expression on the basis of its ability to display inducible dna binding activity oligomerization and nuclear localization in response to environmental stressors such as elevated temperatures and cadmium 26 these multilevel toxic mechanisms may explain the somewhat stronger signal that is substantiated by the incubation time dependent increase and saturation of the mrna expression levels as determined by qrt pcr and the increased tgsh levels the general instability of dncb combined with the short term ros buffering capacity of the gsh gssg pool may affect the redox balance of hacat cells much less than cadmium induced damage in summary hsp70b is a well suited biomarker for the detection of a deregulated oxidative stress level by diverse chemical compounds as an increased hsp70b expression correlates with tremendous changes
 of the intracellular tgsh pool independent of the underlying specific toxic mechanisms thus we next developed a sensor cell line based on the hsp70b promoter for the rapid and sensitive in vitro screening of chemicals that are suspected to cause skin irritation 3.2 design of an oxidative stress sensor cell line in hacat cells hacat cells were stably transfected with a plasmid that allows for the expression of gfp under the control of the hsp70b promoter to establish the reporter gene system we first tested for the induction of gfp fluorescence in different clones of stably transfected cells after the exposure of the sensor cells to cdcl_2 and heat shock for each clone of sensor cells the absolute emission output and dynamic range of gfp induction in stress situations was evaluated using flow cytometry data not shown based on these results a single clone that showed the best signal to noise ratio and highest dynamic range following treatment for short time periods was selected for further investigations the threshold point was determined to be the fraction including approximately 95 of control cells that were not exposed to stress intrinsic fluorescence then the number of gfp positive cells was calculated the fraction of gfp positive cells following exposure of the sensor cells to 25 m cdcl_2 for 6 h was 52.5 and 49.7 of the cells were gfp positive after 2 h of exposure to 43 c in the next series of experiments the cells were seeded on coverslips for fluorescence microscopy to quantitatively investigate the expression levels of gfp in an incubation time and dose dependent manner the cells were grown to near confluence and then treated with chemicals to induce oxidative stress the results are presented in figure 4 for the 25 m cdcl_2 and 5 m helenalin treatments the microscopic images indicated a low basal fluorescence of the sensor cells that considerably increased in response to stress a quantitative read out of the stress response that was elicited by the hsp70b gfp cells was desirable for the facilitation of the automated screening of the chemicals that were suspected to cause skin irritation to this end oxidative stress induced gfp fluorescence was determined using quantitative fluorescence microscopy as presented in figure 5 the exposure of the sensor cells to increasing cdcl_2 concentrations induced a concentration and time dependent increase in gfp fluorescence that reached a plateau at approximately 12 fold levels of induction compared with the untreated sensor cells the exposure of the sensor cells to over 60 m cdcl_2 resulted in aberrant cell morphology and eventually decreased gfp fluorescence data not shown fluorescence intensities were recorded for different cdcl_2 concentrations after 6 h of incubation to determine the lowest detectable concentration the lod was defined as the concentration that induced a fluorescence intensity that was equal to or higher than the mean fluorescence of the untreated control cells plus three times the standard error of the measurement according to the three sigma rule data not shown based on this definition the sensor cells displayed an lod of 6 m cdcl_2 for a 6 h exposure time which is comparable to the lod of the applied conventional tgsh assay when the cells were treated with either dncb the a montana extract or helenalin all of which produce oxidative stress similar levels of fluorescence induction were recorded table 1 it is worth noting that the treatment of sensor cells with niso_4 elicited no response which is in accordance with the aforementioned data indicating that niso_4 does not cause oxidative stress in hacat cells the data has also been compared with the values achieved by the former sensor cell line based on hsp72 the novel sensor cell line exhibits a comparable response profile but represents a significant improvement due to its 1.5 fold increased signal to noise ratio these data suggest that the hsp70b based sensor cells are suitable for the quantitative detection of ros induced cytotoxicity under sublethal conditions and shorter incubation periods compared with the endpoint measurements compounds were applied at their ec_80 concentrations of general cytotoxicity as determined by the mtt assay relative gfp fluorescence was standardized to the untreated cells for each data set mean values were calculated from 3 6 independent experiments se 4 conclusions in this study we used genetically modified sensor cells expressing a hsp70b gfp reporter construct to demonstrate that it is possible to sensitively and rapidly quantify an early skin irritation response upon exposure to a panel of test substances that are known to cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis furthermore these data support the view that varying effects of xenobiotics impact non immunological skin cells supporting the importance of further research on keratinocyte participation in the development of pathologic cell states independent of the signaling pathways that are employed or the effects that chemicals or even complex mixtures of natural products may exhibit to cause oxidative stress it was shown here that hsp70b expression and the derived reporter gene output serve as a valuable detection setup that enabled the construction of a rapid and sensitive in vitro pre screening test for oxidative stress dysregulation which is a fundamental characteristic that appears early in the onset of human skin disorders we compared the performance of the novel hsp70b based assay to conventional measurements of tgsh concentrations and received similar response profiles as well as lods following 6 h of incubation tgsh 1 m cdcl_2 and whole cell biosensor 6 m cdcl_2 the sensory method is characterized by a rapid absolute workload due to the elimination of sample preparation it is non destructive and consequently adaptable to real time measurements as well as other non invasive detection procedures such as impedance readouts compared with the previously established hsp72 gfp reporter cells 9 the sensor cell line that was described here represents a significant improvement due to its superior signal to noise ratio that is required for optimal sensor integration towards the development and evaluation tas for application in dermatology toxicology pharmacology and drug screenings the integration of the developed toxicity assay into a tas has the big advantage that it works as shown in this paper under incubator free conditions the constant microfluidic stream of culture medium together with the temperature control und the use of co_2 independent medium for stabilized ph enables the creation of microsystems incorporating several steps of an assay into a single system under such conditions miniaturized complex systems for a broad field of applications can be easily developed such integrated microfluidic devices perform rapid and reproducible measurements on small sample volumes while eliminating the need for expensive instrumentation and labour intensive laboratory manipulations we thank anne gompf leibniz institute for age research fritz lipmann institute for performing the flow

Q introduction gallbladder polyps gbp are defined as lesions protruding from the gallbladder mucosa that are usually found incidentally by ultrasonography usg 1 gbp are classified into two categories true polypoid neoplasms including benign adenomas and adenocarcinomas and non neoplastic polyps including cholesterol polyps inflammatory polyps and adenomyomatous hyperplasia 2 the clinical implication of gbp lies in its malignant potential although the reported malignancy rate of gbp is only 3 8 3 late or missed diagnoses of gallbladder cancer may be fatal the overall 5 yr survival rate of gallbladder cancer is historically 5 however this has improved dramatically with early treatment 4 thus gbp should be detected as early as possible unfortunately usg which is commonly chosen as the initial imaging modality for evaluating gallbladder problems has low sensitivity for the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer until advanced disease stages 5 although several early gallbladder cancers present as gbp on usg the biologic nature of gbp is difficult to discern prior to surgical resection 6 these facts highlight the clinical significance of gbp because the pathogenesis of gbp has not yet been clearly defined evaluating risk factors for gbp will increase its understanding diagnosis and prevention the detection rate of gbp has been increasing due to improved usg quality and availability several studies have reported the prevalence of gbp as identified on usg 7 8 however the prevalence of gbp varies widely among populations and study designs and there are few data on the population adjusted prevalence and changes in gbp risk factors for 10 yr in a specific ethnic population therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the shifting prevalence and risk factors for gbp in korea materials and methods subjects between january 2002 and december 2012 48 591 20 yr of age subjects underwent abdominal usg as part of a health check up at keimyung university dongsan medical center in daegu korea we retrospectively reviewed the subjects medical records after excluding subjects who underwent cholecystectomy age and gender matched random sampling was performed considering the population composition ratio the sampling process was based on the data from the korea national statistical office population census conducted in 2010 9 this study included 14 250 consecutive subjects 6 898 men and 7 352 women to evaluate the gbp trends over time we divided the total 11 yr time frame into period a 2002 2004 and period b 2010 2012 of the total 14 250 subjects 3 772 were included in period a and 4 962 were included in period b table 1 shows the age and gender distribution of the studied population in periods a and b if a subject underwent more than one health screening at our center the most recent data were analyzed diagnosis of gbp after fasting for at least 11 hr prior to the examination radiology specialists performed usg examinations using an acuson 128xp 10 acuson charleston road ca usa and philips iu22 philips bothell wa usa equipped with a 3.5 5.0 mhz ultrasound probe according to the standard radiologic criteria gbp were diagnosed if the lesions were immobile hyperechoic masses without acoustic shadowing that were attached to the gallbladder gb wall 10 analysis of risk factors blood serum samples were collected early in the morning after the subject had fasted for at least 8 hr levels of fasting plasma glucose fpg aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt total cholesterol triglyceride tg high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c  glutamyl transferase  gtp and total bilirubin were measured using a hitachi 747 autoanalyzer hitachi nakashi tokyo japan hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag and hepatitis

calculated by dividing weight by height squared kg m_2 obesity was defined according to world health organization bmi criteria for an asian population as bmi 25 kg m_2 11 blood pressure bp was measured at each patient s left arm in the seated position after 5 10 min of quiet rest using a mercury sphygmomanometer a subject was considered to have hypertension htn if they had a systolic bp 140 mmhg or diastolic bp 90 mmhg or were taking anti hypertensive agents 12 diabetes mellitus dm was diagnosed when the fpg level was 126 mg dl the hemoglobin a1c level was 6.5 or a patient was being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin impaired fasting glucose ifg was defined as a fpg level of 100 125 mg dl 13 the categorized cut off value of serum biochemistry was determined according to the reference standard of our laboratory statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using spss version 18.0 spss inc chicago il usa student s t test was used to compare continuous variables categorical variables were analyzed using pearson s chi square and and fisher s exact test logistic regression analysis was used to analyze potential risk factors for gbp two tailed p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant ethics statement the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of keimyung university irb no 13 273 informed consent was waived by the board results general characteristics of gbp table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of the korean population estimated from period a to period b the presence of hbsag p 0.001 was more frequently observed in period a than in period b subjects in the two periods did not differ in age gender distribution mean bmi presence of htn dm ifg or gb stone and other laboratory parameter the mean gbp sizes were 4.10 1.94 mm in period a and 3.67 1.61 mm in period b a total of 68.1 92 3 772 of gbp in period a and 73.8 256 4 962 of gbp in period b were 5 mm prevalence of gbp among a total of 14 250 subjects 765 had gbp and the overall prevalence through the 11 yr time period was approximately 6.3 the annual prevalence of gbp is shown in fig 1 the prevalence curve increased linearly from 2.9 in 2002 to 8.5 in 2012 from period a to b mean annual prevalence increased from 3.8 to 7.1 during the total study period the average ages of the gbp and control groups were 42.55 12.75 and 43.29 13.77 yr respectively gbp were more frequently found in men 434 6 898 6.3 than in women 331 7 352 4.5 the prevalence of gbp was further stratified by gender in the different age groups in periods a and b men showed a higher prevalence than women in all age groups and in both periods the peak prevalence was in men 30 39 yr of age 7.0 in period a and 9.3 in period b fig 2 factors related to gbp univariate analysis showed that age p 0.042 male gender p 0.002 obesity p 0.001 and the presence of hbsag p 0.001 were significantly associated with gbp in period a whereas age p 0.010 male gender p 0.001 obesity p 0.001 high tg levels p 0.001 low hdl levels p 0.001 and high ast levels p 0.030 were significantly associated with a high probability of gbp in period b table 3 on multivariate analysis male gender odds ratio or 1.55 95 confidence interval ci 1.08 2.23 p 0.018 and obesity or 1.90 95 ci 1.32 2.72 p 0.001 were significantly associated with gbp in both periods however hbsag lost its significance in period b instead hyper tg or 1.48 95 ci 1.09 2.01 p 0.013 and low hdl or 1.38 95 ci 1.06 1.81 p 0.018 were correlated with gbp in period b table 4 discussion the prevalence rates of gbp vary among countries and regions results from western studies have shown a gbp prevalence of 1.4 6.9 10 14 15 whereas asian studies have shown a gbp prevalence of 2.2 9.5 1 16 17 such geographic differences may be associated with different genetic and environmental factors the prevalence of gbp in korea is not high the reported prevalence rate was 2.2 in 1998 2003 17 however with social and environmental changes increasing life expectancies greater levels of health consciousness and the increased popularity of usg the prevalence of gbp in korea has increased from period a to b the population adjusted prevalence rate of gbp increased from 3.8 to 7.1 the increase in prevalence observed between the two periods of our study corresponded with those observed in other studies 18 19 many studies have reported on the risk factors that predispose patients to developing gbp it is known that male gender is a risk factor for gbp 8 consistent with previous studies we found that men had a higher prevalence of gbp than did women in all age groups in periods a and b the prevalence of gbp peaked in men 30 39 yr of age in both of these periods in most studies the highest prevalence of gbp has been observed in the third to fifth decades of life 1 16 the reasons for peak incidence of gbp in middle aged people are still unclear in our study the fact that most of subjects who had undergone cholecystectomy were in their 50s and 60s or older may partly affect the high prevalence rate of gbp in middle aged subjects in logistic regression analysis no association was observed between age and gbp in this study however male gender seems to be a significant risk factor for gbp the impact of obesity on the development of gbp has been documented in several studies 1 17 obesity is a global public health problem according to the national survey the overall prevalence of obesity in korea increased during the period of 1998 2010 20 in the current study obesity was a common risk factor for gbp in periods a and b hence gbp appears to be predominant in obese subjects and the increase in the prevalence of gbp can be partly attributed to the increasing rates of obesity several authors found that the prevalence of gbp was higher in patients with hbv infection than in those without hbv infection 8 16 meanwhile others did not find a relationship between hbv infection and gbp
 21 22 the underlying mechanism of this association remains elusive 8 in the present study the presence of hbsag had statistical meaning in period a however it was not continuously meaningful in period b this result is probably related to the nationwide hbv vaccination program korea was an endemic area for hbv infection in the past the korean government s universal hbv vaccination program which started in 1991 was administered to all infants in 1995 23 as a result the prevalence of hbsag in the korean population has steadily decreased from 4.60 in 2001 to 2.98 in 2010 24 although korea is still endemic for hbv infection 25 this dramatic decline in the general population may influence the changing risk factors for gbp in the current study elevated tg and low hdl levels were significantly associated with gbp most gbp are cholesterol polyps although the pathogenesis of gbp remains poorly understood several investigators have hypothesized that direct deposition of bile or blood cholesterol may contribute to the formation of cholesterol polyps 26 in support of this mechanism a similar association has been suggested between gbp and lipid profile abnormalities 27 28 however this shift in association in the current study was distinctly different from that reported in previous studies our results suggested that lipid profile abnormalities are emerging risk factors the reason for this shift in temporal trends is unclear however we hypothesized that it is probably associated with the lifestyle and diet changes in koreans with the rapid socioeconomic development of the past few decades koreans have experienced remarkable transitions in lifestyle as well as food choices 29 according to the data from the korean nationwide survey the prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased substantially in recent years 30 the most remarkable finding of this study is that this emerging trend of lipid profile abnormality is contrary to the trends of loss in the significance of hbv infection in recent years considering these results we assumed that the transition of gbp risk factors may be attributable to the changes in social economy and health policies in korea the increasing prevalence of gbp observed in our study can be explained by the changing trends in risk factors especially metabolic status such as obesity and dyslipidemia may had an important role in increasing prevalence of gbp however it is rather premature to conclude that the increased prevalence is only a consequence of shifting trends in risk factors indeed the prevalence of gbp may yet be attributed to unrevealed risk factors furthermore increased detectability probably accounts for the increased prevalence compared with period a polyps smaller than 5 mm were more frequently observed in period b numerous recent studies support our results that this finding is likely due to the increased availability and improved technology of usg 16 22 several recent studies have advocated the role of metabolic syndrome in gbp 8 22 unfortunately we could not evaluate the same because waist circumference was not included among the routine check up items of the examinations performed at our health screening center furthermore htn and ifg which are contributors to metabolic syndrome were not identified as risk factors for gbp in this study our study had several limitations first because of age and gender matched selection relatively few cases were ultimately included however this is a common difficulty in evaluating the prevalence rate because subjects who visit a single health screening center are not representative of an entire community second fpg was measured at one time only during a single visit according to the current definition 31 dm is diagnosed only once a fpg level of 126 mg dl is documented twice similarly bp was measured once during a single visit htn is diagnosed on the basis of the average of at least two bp readings at more than two visits after the initial screening 12 although these methods were inevitable due to the retrospective design of this study the fact that htn and dm can be over or underestimated may have affected the results third it is often difficult to discriminate between small polyps 5 mm and gb stones in the present study most of the polyps were 5 mm and the diagnosis of gbp was based on the usg criteria despite these limitations the strength of this study is its design which documented the changes over a long period of time based on population adjusted selection most epidemiologic studies on gbp were not based on population adjusted results so it is possible that an inappropriate distribution of age and sex was analyzed to our knowledge this is the first report of the temporal changes in the prevalence and risk factors of gbp for 10 yr in korea thus the results of this study are reliable and could be representative of the general korean population in conclusion gbp are not rare and the prevalence of gbp increased dramatically from 2002 to 2012 the risk factors for gbp have also changed over time the risk factors for gbp are shifting from hbsag positivity to increased tg levels and decreased hdl levels male gender obesity and lipid profile abnormalities are the current risk factors for gbp in korea these results may be a valuable resource for health education health care policy and future studies the authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose 1 segawa k arisawa t niwa y suzuki t tsukamoto y goto h hamajima e shimodaira m ohmiya n prevalence of gallbladder polyps among apparently

Q 1 introduction wearable sensors are becoming smaller and increasingly widely used resulting in an increasing need for independent and compact power supplies electrochemical batteries the most common power supplies for wearable sensors cannot meet the need because of their limited energy storage capacity and potential environmental and health risks emerging as a critical bottleneck for wearable sensors this has driven the development of wearable energy harvesters which harvest the mechanical energy dissipated in human motion to provide renewable and clean energy 1 several concepts of wearable energy harvesters based on different mechanisms have been studied such as electromagnetic 2 5 electrostatic 6 thermoelectric 7 nano triboelectric 8 and piezoelectric 9 13 piezoelectric energy harvesters and nano triboelectric generators can convert mechanical energy into electric energy directly thus their structures are more compact and simpler in comparison to those of other types the materials for nano triboelectric generators are generally not accessible in the market hence this work focuses on piezoelectric energy harvesters lead zirconate titanate pzt and polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf are the two most important piezoelectric materials for energy harvesting owing to their high piezoelectric performance pzt is rigid brittle and heavy bringing limitations in wearable applications where flexibility is necessary pvdf has considerable flexibility good stability and is easy to handle and shape 14 taking into account the human motion characteristics of high amplitude and low frequency pvdf is more appropriate for wearable applications than pzt pvdf has been used in wearable energy harvesters that are implemented in shoes 15 16 bags 17 18 and clothing 19 21 kymissis et al 16 developed an insole made of eight layer stacks of 28 m pvdf sheets with a central 2 mm flexible plastic substrate it harnessed the parasitic energy in shoes and the average power reached 1.1 mw at 1 hz granstrom et al 17 utilized pvdf straps as backpack shoulder straps to collect mechanical energy produced by the backpack with an average power of 45.6 mw during a walking of 0.9 1.3 m s yang and yun 21 fabricated a pvdf shell structure generating an output power of 0.87 mw at a folding angle of 80 and a folding and unfolding frequency of 3.3 hz which could be worn on the elbow joint to harvest energy from human motion the mechanical energy dissipated in shoes can even power a computer serving as an attractive energy source for wearable harvesters 1 this paper develops a shoe embedded piezoelectric energy harvester which can be integrated in a shoe readily for energy harvesting from human locomotion with little discomfort for the wearers the harvester is based on a specially designed sandwich structure resulting in a thin geometrical form a high performance and an excellent durability two harvester prototypes are made and tested the first one is made up of a multilayer pvdf film and a structure of engineering plastics which is placed under the heel the second one is designed as an insole shape and used as a normal insole consisting of a structure of flexible silicone rubber and two multilayer pvdf films more power can be generated by the former prototype while the other one has an advantage of remarkable comfort in order to store the harvested energy and provide a constant dc output voltage a power management circuit is designed a series of experiments are performed to characterize the harvester prototypes proving that the harvester can serve as a wearable power supply for low power wearable sensors and potentially provide a valuable alternative to the use of batteries 2 harvester design the main structure of the harvester is a sandwich structure where a multilayer pvdf film is sandwiched between two wavy surfaces of a movable upper plate and a lower plate as shown in figure 1a the multilayer pvdf film figure 1b is fixed on the lower plate and composed of several pvdf layers which are wired in parallel for a high output current when the upper plate is subject to a compressive force produced by foot the upper plate moves down and the pvdf film is stretched along 1 axis simultaneously as presented in figure 1c this leads to a piezoelectric field created inside every pvdf layer driving the free electrons in the external circuit to accumulate on the upper and lower 3 axis surfaces electrodes of every pvdf layer to screen the piezo potential when the force is lifted the upper plate moves up and the pvdf film is relaxed therefore the piezo potential diminishes resulting in releasing the accumulated electrons a dynamic force f_foot applied by foot on the upper plate drives the electrons in the external circuit to flow back and forth with an alternating current ac output the sandwich structure is characterized by the inner wavy surfaces where arc shaped grooves and arc shaped ribs exist the specially designed surfaces enable the pvdf film to generate a large longitudinal deformation and reduce the harvester thickness which enhances the harvesting performance and makes it possible to integrate the harvester into a shoe whose inner space is limited the design parameters are defined in table 1 and presented in figure 1d an optimization method is utilized to design the harvester and the objective function constraint conditions and value ranges of parameters will be established when the upper plate moves down to the lowest position both the tension of the multilayer pvdf film f_1 and the resistive force f_3 against the upper plate produced by the pvdf film reach maximum the tension f_1 can be expressed by 1 f1 na11 2 1 1y 3 1 lsinint l l l l lsin l l l l sin 1 where _1 is the normal stress _1 is the normal strain for simplicity of description the frictions between the pvdf film and the two wavy surfaces are ignored and the resistive force f_3 figure 2 can be given in equation 4 4 f3 int l l 2f1sin l l 2f1 1 cos 2nwhll  sin y the quantity of charges produced by the pvdf film during the period that the upper plate moves down to the lowest position is equal to the quantity of charges generated during the period that the upper plate moves up to the initial position according to the piezoelectric effect the charge quantity q is written below and d_31 is the piezoelectric constant 5 q n d311a1lh d31na3 sin 1 y q is the key parameter to describe the energy harvesting performance of the piezoelectric harvester and the larger q the better hence equation 5 is the objective function for the design optimization in equations 3 5 int l l is approximated as l l leading to the approximate expressions of _1 f_3 and q at the cost of accuracy these expressions reduce calculation cost and are deemed sufficient for the harvester design where high precision is not required in order to improve the durability of the multilayer pvdf film the wavy surfaces must be carefully designed to keep the pvdf film from experiencing plastic deformation moreover another two factors need taking into account when designing the harvester the first is that the resistive force f_3 should be lower than the driving force f_foot the second is that the harvester thickness should be less than a set value t_m for a thin geometrical form of the harvester therefore the constraint conditions for the design are presented in the equation below 6 1 sin 1 ef3 2nwhll  sin y ffootts nh 2 l2 1 cossin nh ltan 2 tmwhere _e is the elastic limit of the pvdf film t_s is the sum of the thicknesses of the multilayer pvdf film and a groove and a rib the value ranges of the above design parameters can be determined by the application requirements of a specific design 3 fabrication two prototypes of the harvester are fabricated for two different purposes prototype 1 is made up of a multilayer pvdf film and a structure of rigid engineering plastics for a high output power prototype 2 is designed as an insole shape consisting of a structure of flexible silicone rubber and two multilayer pvdf films with an advantage of excellent comfort the multilayer pvdf film is composed of a stack of several pvdf layers connected in parallel the properties of the pvdf layers are listed in table 2 in order to provide a dc source for electronics a power management circuit is utilized 3.1 fabrication of prototype 1 prototype 1 is designed to exploit the high pressure exerted in heel strikes the schematic of prototype 1 is shown in figure 3a the upper plate and the lower plate are made of engineering plastics whose stiffness is far greater than that of the pvdf film the multilayer pvdf film is bolted to the lower plate as presented in figure 3b according to table 2 the elastic region of the pvdf layer is about 0 2 hence the normal strain _1 should be no more than 2 the dynamic foot pressure distribution is studied in reference 22 showing that the peak force of a heel strike is about 400 n thus the resistive force f_3 is better no more than 400 n the total thicknesses t_s is set to not exceed 3 mm equation 6 indicates that  reaches the maximum value of 19.7 when _1 equals to 2 the value ranges of n l and  are defined in equation 7 besides the pvdf film length l is 80 mm and the width w is 50 mm for a normal heel size the harvester is designed by using optimization method in conjunction with matlab built in optimization routines several solutions are obtained among them it is found that the solution of l 10 mm n 8 as well as  19.7 is the optimal solution which is selected for prototype 1 7 1 n 815  20 5mm l 20mm 3.2 fabrication of prototype 2 prototype 2 is designed as an insole shape as illustrated in figure 4a which can be divided into three parts part 1 and part 2 are the sandwich structures for harvesting energy with two 8 layer pvdf films similar to the rigid energy harvester part 1 is applied to harness the energy from heel strikes part 2 is used to tap
 the energy dissipated in bending of the shoe part 3 is under foot arch where foot pressure is low which is a chamber offering vacant space to accommodate circuits and energy storage devices the upper plate and the lower plate are made of silicone rubber by injecting modeling process whose stiffness is far less than that of the engineering plastics used in prototype 1 therefore the practical pvdf film deformation is lower than the theoretical maximum value calculated by equation 3 in order to reduce this adverse influence caused by the flexible material the angle  is increased to 27.7 resulting in a theoretical maximum normal strain _1 of 4 the chord length l is assigned 10 mm the upper plate the lower plate and two multilayer pvdf films are fixed together by bolts and the finished prototype 2 is shown in figure 4b 3.3 power circuit the pvdf film generates ac power with high voltage and low current which cannot meet the need of commercial electronics that are practically driven by a uniform dc power furthermore if wearable sensors are not in operation the harvested energy needs storing in a storage device based on the above the two considerations a power management circuit is designed as diagrammed in figure 5 mainly consisting of two full bridge rectifiers a buck converter two button batteries optional and some capacitors the buck converter and one rectifier are contained in the chip ltc 3588 1 two rectifiers can simultaneously rectify two ac currents of different phases respectively which is useful for prototype 2 the harvested energy accumulates on the input capacitor c_in and then transferred by the buck converter to the output capacitor c_out the target value of the output voltage v_out the voltage across output capacitor c_out is set to 3.6 v when v_out reaches the target value a logic high is produced on the pgoog pin if the load shuts off or the input power is more than the output power there exists unused energy which will be stored in the batteries on the contrary if the harvester cannot generate enough power to meet the load demand the batteries will be discharged to offer supplemental power 4 experiments and results prototype 1 and prototype 2 were implemented in shoes to harness the parasitic energy during walking as shown in figure 6 a series of experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the prototypes in the first experiment the prototype was terminated with a matched resistor s hence yielded maximum power transfer in the second experiment the quantities of the charge produced by the prototypes during one step q_s were measured in the third and fourth experiment the prototypes were connected with the power management circuit without using batteries to form dc power supply systems the start up time of the systems were measured besides the power supply systems were tested to power a simulated transmitter load 4.1 performance of prototype 1 prototype 1 with an 8 layer pvdf film the capacitance of the pvdf film was 126 nf was mounted on the inner sole and harnessed energy under the heel firstly prototype 1 was tested during a brisk walk at roughly 1 hz 23 and terminated with a 1.268 m resistor figure 7 shows the voltages across the resistor and the resulting power delivered to the resistor the peak to peak values of the voltage were about 136 v the peak power was roughly 4 mw and the mean power was much lower with a value of about 1 mw meaning that the average net energy transfer was about 1 mj per step it demonstrates that the harvester is an attractive alternative for powering some low wearable sensors such as activity trackers blood pressure sensors and sensors for healthcare 24 secondly q_s was measured by using an energy storage circuit shown in figure 8 during one step 25 the increment of the voltage on the storage capacitor c_s was u_s about 30 c charge was produced per step if two button batteries gmb301009 for example with a capacity of 2 8 mah are charged by prototype 1 as shown in figure 5 they can completely charge from empty in 1.92 million steps about 200 days with 10 000 steps per day 2 8 ma 3600 s 30 c step 1 920 000 steps 10 000 step day 200 day although it is not an optimal way to charge batteries the battery lifetime can be prolonged owing to the harvester thirdly the start up time of dc power supply system consisting of prototype 1 and the power management circuit was measured figure 9 shows two measured voltages on c_in and c_out the voltage on c_in increased during every step and when it surpassed the threshold of about 4.8 v the energy would be transferred to c_out meanwhile c_in discharged and its voltage declined rapidly with an increment of the voltage on c_out it indicates that after 13 steps the voltages across c_out the output voltage v_out reached the set value 3.6 v hence the setup time of the system was about 13 s during a walk of 1 hz which was not a long waiting time for wearers fourthly the complete dc power supply system was tested by powering a simulated wireless transmitter 26 as shown in figure 10 the simulated load was modeled as a 180  resistor load r_load which was controllable by pulse width modulated pwm signal with a duty cycle of 0.5 and a frequency of 1 hz when the output voltage of the power supply system was ready pgood at logic high the supply rails to the simulated load was activated and energy was consumed prototype 1 was driven at roughly 2 hz figure 10 shows the representative signals from the complete power supply system when powering the simulated load the red trace is the output voltage v_out and the black trace is the voltage across the resistor load v_r load the simulated transmitter load was activated once every 2 3 steps because the load dissipated power faster than the harvester generated power v_out and v_r load fell when the simulated load was active during the active period of 5 ms v_r load declined from 3.4 v to 2.7 v and the calculated values of the mean load power and the mean load current were 50 mw and 16 ma respectively the power output could certainly be used to power some low power wireless transmitters such as transmitters based on bluetooth low energy ble or ant 4.2 performance of prototype 2 the insole shaped prototype 2 with two 8 layer pvdf films was placed in a shoe and tested during a walk at about 1 hz the capacitances of the pvdf film placed under forefoot and the pvdf film placed under heel were 250 nf and 110 nf respectively the four experiments executed above were also done for prototype 2 in the first experiment the forefoot placed pvdf film was connected with a 660 k resistor r_f and the heel placed pvdf film was terminated with a 1.682 m resistor r_h the voltages across the resistors and the powers were presented in figure 11 obviously the two output voltages had different phases the heel placed pvdf film produced peak to peak voltages of roughly 30 v while the forefoot placed pvdf film gave lower response with peak to peak values approaching 22 v the mean powers were 30 w for the heel placed pvdf film and 90 w for the forefoot placed pvdf film in total about 0.12 mj per step could be supplied which was significantly lower than the energy of 1 mj per step provided by prototype 1 that was because the pvdf film deformations in prototype 2 was smaller than those in prototype 1 in the second experiment about 5 c charges could be generated by the heel placed pvdf film during one step and 11 c for the forefoot placed pvdf film as shown in figure 12 in the third experiment the two pvdf films were wired with the two rectifiers of the power management circuit respectively and the harvester served as a dc power supply system the output voltage reached the set value 3.6 v after 25 steps in the fourth experiment the power supply system could activate the simulated load once every 6 8 steps in conclusion prototype 2 offers more comfort for users compared to prototype 1 at a cost of generating performance 5 discussion compared with other reported shoe embedded pvdf energy harvesters the harvester proposed here has advantages of a thin geometrical form high performance and an excellent durability benefitting from its specially designed sandwich structure the deformation of the multilayer pvdf film is kept elastic and the maximum deformation is close to pvdf elastic limit thus there is a tradeoff between performance and durability the average power of the harvester is up to 1 mw at 1 hz which approximates the power of 1.1 mw at 1 hz of the pvdf insole in reference 15 while more comfort and durability can be provided by our design by combining the merits of prototype 1 and prototype 2 a better harvester can be developed in the future work the arc shaped grooves and ribs on the wavy surfaces will be made of some harder material polyurethane for example to improve the pvdf film deformation for more energy produced and the other parts of the plates are made of flexible material to keep users comfortable in addition increasing the number of pvdf layers serves as another approach to improving generating performance 6 conclusions a shoe embedded piezoelectric energy harvester is developed in this paper and it can be integrated in a shoe readily for energy harvesting from human locomotion two prototypes with different characteristics are fabricated and tested one prototype produces more energy while the other one is more comfortable without creating any inconvenience or discomfort for wearers the dc power supply system including the harvester and a power management circuit is used to collect the mechanical energy dissipated in shoes and power some low power wearable sensors such as activity trackers even though the harvester is unlikely to replace completely the batteries in all wearable sensors it is a significant role in reducing the problems related to the use of batteries the work presents a successful attempt in harnessing

Q background currently more than 40 million women use injectable contraceptives to prevent pregnancy _1 the most common injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate dmpa is a progesterone only product administered through a single intramuscular injection in the upper arm or buttocks that lasts for 3 months other injectable contraceptives include 1 month combined hormonal products and a 2 month progesterone product _2 between 1995 and 2005 injectable contraceptive use doubled worldwide _3 in sub saharan africa more than one third of modern contraceptive users currently rely on injectable contraceptives _4 dramatic increases in injectable uptake have occurred in several african countries including kenya and rwanda _5 _ _6 however injectable discontinuation is high due in part to women experiencing menstrual and weight changes or other side effects _7 _ _12 additionally as many as 40 of injectable users unintentionally discontinue due to missed appointments for reinjection _13 _ _14 injectable users who are late for a reinjection are often asked to return to the clinic during their next menses increasing the likelihood of pregnancy before the next injection _15 between 1995 and 2005 injectable use doubled worldwide but discontinuation remains high due to side effects and missed reinjections a longer acting injectable lai lasting for at least 6 months could prove to be a valuable addition to the method mix by decreasing the number of visits required of clients per year thereby improving compliance and increasing effectiveness during typical use of the method with funding from the bill melinda gates foundation fhi 360 is spearheading efforts to develop an lai that would provide protection for a minimum of 6 months approaches under consideration include a increasing the dosage of an existing injectable formulation b altering the administration or injection site or c identifying drug delivery systems that could prolong the release of the drug by reducing the number of reinjection visits a longer acting injectable could potentially improve compliance and reduce unintentional discontinuation this research aimed to inform the development process of an lai by providing a more in depth understanding of the perspectives of potential users providers and opinion leaders on the target product profile tpp which identifies desired and minimally acceptable product characteristics related to such aspects as effectiveness and side effect profile the results are intended to help inform the selection of potential product formulations for early proof of concept testing as well as for later product development efforts another paper is planned to present and discuss how tpp characteristics may affect health systems and introduction decisions more broadly such decisions will influence women s access to an lai by affecting the method s affordability availability and ease of adoption further affecting how well potential users can adhere to and sustain use of the new method methods between june and september 2012 we conducted qualitative case studies in kenya and rwanda 2 countries with high levels of injectable contraceptive use but different service delivery environments in each country we recruited providers including nurses counselors and community health workers chws as well as potential users from private and public sector clinics in the capital city and several peri urban or rural areas research assistants approached women in clinic waiting rooms to inform them about the study the research assistants screened interested women to ensure they were 18 50 years old and they provided women with an informational voucher to attend a focus group discussion fgd with current and previous injectable users or with

participants split into 2 groups and provided 2 separate rankings idis and fgds were audio recorded translated into french or english and transcribed the documents were then uploaded into nvivo 9 and the information was coded and analyzed thematically we wrote detailed memos describing subthemes related to each main code including each of the tpp characteristics we also created excel matrices to

ngos and universities who were identified as international family planning opinion leaders by peers organizations included the international planned parenthood federation the united nations population fund the world health organization the u s agency for international development abt associates the population council management sciences for health marie stopes international and others we received 28 responses the opinion leaders were asked open ended questions about whether they perceived a need for an lai what characteristics would be important and what challenges might exist related to lai development and introduction responses were organized into a matrix by topic the study was approved by fhi 360 s protection of human subjects committee and by the institutional review boards in kenya and rwanda results the conceptual framework in figure 1 provides an overview of the themes we analyzed and their relationship to lai acceptability many women and providers policy makers spontaneously expressed strong interest in an lai in general we found that women s interest in an lai was informed by specific tpp product characteristics that influenced how well the product fit their fertility

hypothetical lai acceptability we also indicate when such perspectives diverge between potential users and providers or by country and how they compare to responses from the international opinion leaders effectiveness 99 effective in preventing pregnancy when used correctly being at least 99 effective was ranked as the most important lai characteristic by most participant groups from the 2 country case studies but mentioned by only 7 of 28 international opinion leaders as a critical characteristic probably because they assumed high effectiveness was a given as one opinion leader noted safety and efficacy are of course a no brainer high effectiveness was ranked the most important characteristic of a potential longer acting injectable by most participants despite strong endorsement from kenyan and rwandan participants their understanding of effectiveness was often based less on a quantitative understanding of rate and more on subjective experiences with other contraceptive methods about a dozen potential users and providers incorrectly suggested that all other contraceptive methods are 100 effective so an lai should also be 100 effective similarly a kenyan provider said i have never heard of any person who has ever used depo and still conceived when the method was used correctly in contrast twice as many women believed that no method was completely effective a kenyan woman who had never used injectables acknowledged it s okay if the method is 98 or 99 effective because there are no methods that are 100 effective a handful of past and never users set minimum effectiveness as low as 45 50 before other fgd participants clarified the meaning of effectiveness rates dmpa and other contraceptive experiences more generally women and providers thought of an lai as extending the period of protection of the existing dmpa injectable making it even easier and more convenient to use in both countries potential users and providers frequently contrasted the reliability of the 3 month injectable to women s experiences using oral contraceptive pills for example a young rwandan injectable user explained usually what s good about the 3 month injectable is that you are at ease for 3 months it s only important not to forget the date to go back to the clinic it s not like with pills that you can forget to take despite a widespread perception that current injectable contraception was highly effective some women in almost all kenyan fgds and half of rwandan fgds also described instances of their own or another s unplanned pregnancy while using injectables such instances were usually attributed to returning late for a reinjection however in 7 fgds in kenya participants attributed contraceptive failure to the possibility of being administered a fake or an expired drug this concern led one kenyan contraceptive user to choose pills because i m assured of not getting pregnant when i m on the pills unlike the injection where some people are injected with water instead of the drug effectiveness and lai approaches potential users and providers had little problem imagining how to achieve a highly effective lai based on increasing the dose of an existing hormone however some participants wondered how other approaches to achieving an lai might work for example a subcutaneous injection was viewed by some as likely to be less effective one kenyan woman from a non injectable user group wondered how is the drug going to move because when you are injected they usually target a vein that is going to transport the medicine all over so if it is under the skin where are they aiming it i would prefer it to be injected deep in the muscles so i am sure it is going to reach the veins and the medicine will be transported all over a subcutaneous injection was viewed as being less effective than an intramuscular injection by some participants such views emerged strongly in 2 kenyan fgds of non users as well as in 1 fgd of current or past injectable users another kenyan woman indicated okay for less pain i would prefer under the skin but to be sure it will work i would go for the deeper one in rwanda at least a few participants in fgds of current past or never users also suggested that an intramuscular injection might be more effective than a subcutaneous one however slightly more rwandan potential users had a clear preference for subcutaneous injections which they believed would be less painful side effects no worse than currently available hormonal methods injectables providers potential users and opinion leaders had different perspectives on the relative importance for a new lai to minimize side effects among all kenyan focus groups as well as among providers in both countries ensuring that lai side effects are no worse than currently available methods was among the 3 most endorsed characteristics in contrast it was ranked as a least important characteristic among potential users in rwanda minimizing side effects was more important for potential users in kenya than in rwanda when opinion leaders were asked about important considerations for an lai the most frequent response reported by 21 of 27 opinion leaders was side effects some opinion leaders stated that the side effects associated with an lai should be no worse than those associated with dmpa while others expressed the hope that an lai would have a better side effect profile than currently available injectables dmpa experiences providers and potential user groups associated a number of side effects with current injectable use including increased menstrual bleeding and amenorrhea decreased libido weight changes headaches and dizziness certain side effects especially heavier or prolonged bleeding and decreased libido could disrupt marital relations and or work patterns making them less tolerated than other side effects the possibility of discreet contraceptive use was cited by several kenyan policy makers and at least a dozen women in each country as an important reason to use the injectable side effects such as increased bleeding and decreased libido that disrupt marital relations or daily activities were less tolerated than other side effects in rwanda a 38 year old injectable user with 4 children described her symptoms i am using the 3 month injectable but i bleed and don t dry out currently i have some serious problems with my husband because i am turning him away we re not really on good terms sometimes he asks me to stop he also asks me why i am using it a community health worker in rwanda suggested prolonged or heavy bleeding and also decreased sexual desire weigh most on clients what is not very worrisome for women is amenorrhea but weight gain is also a problem for women because the way they change shape is really noticeable and rapid and then having no desire for your husband even though he is the one who brought you from your parents home is also a problem and this bleeding that happens unexpectedly and lasts for weeks also becomes bothersome women in both countries believed that certain side effects were interconnected for example in 3 of 9 rwandan fgds and 7 of 10 kenyan fgds some women associated amenorrhea with the possibility of swelling weight gain abscesses infertility or cancer a kenyan injectable user said when in my second year of using the injection i completely stopped getting my periods my stomach started to swell and it reached a time instead of the period i was very wet in my vagina and my sexual desire diminished on the other hand not all side effects were viewed negatively several women in rwanda and one in kenya appreciated weight gain due to injectable use several dozen participants including 6 kenyan providers program managers and potential users from both countries associated amenorrhea with time and cost savings one rural injectable user in rwanda explained the first advantage of the injectable is that you don t see your period and so you don t spend money buying kotex or soap to wash your sanitary napkins you have that money for other things women indicated that most contraceptive methods had side effects indeed women s descriptions of side effects related to pills injectables and implants and sometimes even intrauterine devices iuds were similar they also indicated that side effects were frequently transitory for many women side effects were problematic only if they lasted a long time or were so severe that they disrupted women s normal routines in such cases they might assume that the contraceptive method being
 used did not suit their bodies leading them to discontinue or switch methods side effects and lai approaches a common concern about a potential lai particularly among women who had already experienced side effects with dmpa was that it might double the intensity of side effects in several fgds and idis participants suggested that developing a nonhormonal lai would be preferable although some equated such nonhormonal approaches to the iud which was also considered to cause side effects for many women a current implant user from rwanda reported even the 3 month one injectable caused me serious bleeding and an excess of hormones above those already in my body in my opinion they should try to lower the quantity of hormones or just simply make a product without any hormones and many would choose this method because when others see the effect that the 3 month injectable had on me or on someone else who had the same problems i did they are afraid to run the same risk others believed that women s experiences with injectable contraception were variable and related to their body s own chemistry consequently if a woman did not experience side effects from a current hormonal method she would be unlikely to experience them with a longer acting one as expressed by one rwandan injectable user you see if the injectable was given every 6 months instead of every 3 that would be very good for me i also think there wouldn t be any side effects because we don t have any with the 3 month injectable we are using return to fertility similar to women who have stopped using nonhormonal methods in general potential users were more concerned than providers about return to fertility and this characteristic was of more concern in kenya than in rwanda in considering an lai women preferred a product that provided an immediate return to fertility however a longer period of time even as long as 18 months could be acceptable particularly if the time period were predictable international opinion leaders generally agreed that return to fertility within a reasonable and predictable time frame was an important priority one respondent stated return to fertility could be problematic if it extended far beyond what we already have with the 3 month injection women preferred an immediate return to fertility but a longer time frame could be acceptable if it were predictable another respondent noted that if an lai were associated with a substantially longer return to fertility than dmpa it would be a major issue for women women who stop using dmpa become pregnant on average 10 months after their last dmpa injection _16 dmpa experiences many potential users and providers in both countries recounted stories about long delays in the return to fertility after injectable discontinuation and in more than half of kenyan fgds and one third of rwandan fgds some women believed that injectable contraception could lead to infertility delays were most commonly attributed to injectable induced changes in menstruation either heavy bleeding or amenorrhea and frequently reflected fundamental misunderstandings about human anatomy and contraception for example a rwandan woman associated heavy bleeding with fertility delays i know about a woman who was using the 3 month injectable and she was bleeding a lot but later when she wanted to have another baby and stopped using it she waited a long time without getting pregnant for at least 5 years when she went to the doctor she was told she would no longer be able to have children because the bleeding carried away her eggs that little remained for her to conceive women attributed delays in return to fertility to bleeding side effects of contraceptive methods a rwandan provider suggested that long periods of amenorrhea could lead to delays we can t say this to our clients but our doctor here always tells us to counsel women to do a sonogram at least once a year because they continue to use the 3 month injectable for a long time without knowing if the uterus has atrophied and when the time comes to want to get pregnant she doesn t conceive because the uterus has atrophied she begins to worry most kenyan providers agreed that delays in the return to fertility were a concern for women but even more so for partners and while few providers suggested that there might be a connection between injectable use and infertility delays in the return to fertility made some reluctant to counsel nulliparous women about injectable use as one kenyan provider reported the injectable cannot make one sterile not unless you had just one good ovum we tell them not to start using family planning when one has not given birth because a woman can start using family planning and they don t have ova to conceive you know she will blame family planning and yet she is the one with the problem or maybe that is the way she has been created so it is good to start using family planning when one has a child that is why it is referred to as family planning nevertheless some women and even some providers and policy makers believed that other contraceptive methods were likely to induce even longer delays in the return to fertility suggesting that return to fertility was somehow directly related to a method s duration of protection in kenya a policy maker reflected mmm i guess probably it s sometimes explained from the perspective of a provider in terms of a continuum with the oral contraceptive pill it s immediate with the injectable it ll take a period from you know 1 3 months or even up to 6 months with the implant and so i think that depending on how it is explained to the client it may be a cause of anxiety return to fertility and lai approaches acceptability of a longer return to fertility for an lai seemed to depend on women s and men s fertility desires if couples were looking for longer protection they would not care about the long return to fertility furthermore if the delay in return to fertility were predictable many suggested that a longer return to fertility might be perceived as a benefit a rwandan provider said if this method had a return to fertility after 18 months for everyone all women would use it because if she wants to get pregnant in 4 years she ll use the method for 1 years and she ll wait another 1 years even though she s already stopped the method i assure you it s like this even those who use implants or the iud will remove them to use this injectable even me my wife doesn t use the injectable but if it s like this i will be interested in this long acting injectable some but not all participants conflated the long contraceptive tail the period in which the drug stops having an acceptable level of effectiveness but has not been fully eliminated from the body with an extended period of effectiveness thus some providers in both kenya and rwanda reasoned that alternatively you can calculate the time that you want to get pregnant and stop like a year before the time you wish to get pregnant if you wanted to get pregnant after 3 years you could use the new method for 2 years and stop then you will get pregnant after 1 year which will add up to 3 years reacting to a similar argument in her discussion group one rwandan woman exclaimed i was thinking about what my colleague just said when she just said that she d stop the injectable when her child is 4 years old is she sure that this injectable will be 100 effective so that when she stops she ll spend 18 months without getting pregnant why do you put it in that kind of logic with the injectable we normally use you can stop and fall pregnant right away why don t you think it could be the same thing remembering that it fertility also depends on each one s body finally several providers suggested that it would be very useful to identify a way to reverse the effect of the drug so that women whose fertility intentions changed would be able to get pregnant more quickly in kenya a provider proposed if there could be a way one would get an injection or drug to reverse back the medication any time they want a baby instead of waiting for the whole period the drug would last then that would be fine like for instance the way one gets rid of pills and conceives almost immediately or getting rid of an iud a handful of potential users from different kenyan fgds also raised the possibility of manufacturing an antidote as described by one non injectable user so they have to go and look for this miti ni dawa herbal treatment so that they can go and wash their stomach that is a traditional drink herbs that you take so that it can go and wash those chemicals which is there delivery system single dose prepackaged disposable injection system potential lai approaches under consideration could result in changes to product presentation for example while the tpp aims for a single injection increasing the dose of an existing formulation might require co administration of 2 doses whereas changes in the drug delivery system could require a 2 vial system for women in about one third of the fgds mostly in rwanda characteristics of product presentation were important to consider for a new lai providers were more divided on whether such characteristics were important a few women in fgds from more rural community based distribution cbd programs felt 2 injections were not problematic but most women and providers strongly preferred an lai to be in a single prepackaged injection kenyan providers worried about client acceptability especially with regard to pain or discomfort in both countries a few women and providers added that providers were not always well trained so 2 injections could lead to even more swelling and pain for example a kenyan provider commented considering that human beings fear pain it 2 shots would minimize the number of clients and so you can be sure that most women would lose interest in the injectable a single prepackaged
 delivery system was generally preferred to facilitate provider provision and reduce user pain or discomfort similarly a rwandan injectable client from a private ngo clinic said it s best to have 1 injection instead of 2 because some people swell at the site of injection for example me after an injection i have pain for about a week so it would be preferable to swell at 1 site rather than 2 sites for some rwandan women receiving 2 shots instead of 1 also increased the perception that one was receiving a very high dose of hormones a woman from a public hospital setting in kigali spoke for her fellow participants when she said why have we all said no it s because we are worrying about the consequences i told you that i had an injection and i bled from the 1st to the 30th and i imagine that the hormones will be double the quantity i won t be able to continue like that for 6 months in that case if you were using sanitary napkins you would have to look for pampers instead of giving you 2 injections at the same time i wish that they could mix the 2 medicines and give them in a single injection providers and potential users in both countries were also concerned about the idea of having to mix medicines before giving an injection concerns related to improper mixing and consequently a reduction in safety or effectiveness participants raised the same kinds of concerns if multiple injections were given from a single vial for example one injectable user in rwanda worried that the medicines from the 2 different injections might not meet within her body causing her some concern about the effectiveness of the lai others described having more confidence in a product that was already premixed and packaged it would be possible to check the expiry date as well a potential user from rwanda explained i think it would be a good thing if the longer acting injectable is put in a single dose because it would prevent people from having to first mix it before giving it or from not drawing out all of the medicine from the vial the provider will spend less time with the client because he is not going to have to prepare it will also prevent him from giving an incomplete dose to the clients finally current or past injectable users in 2 of the rwandan fgds as well as a dozen providers from kenya and rwanda preferred that a new lai be delivered through disposable needles to protect users from infections cost us $4 or less per year in a public sector program cost was one of the most important considerations for international opinion leaders policy makers and providers but one of the least important considerations for most potential users for the opinion leaders affordability was the second most common response 14 of 28 to an open ended question about which characteristics would be most important for a new lai one opinion leader stated cost of the final product may be a challenge it should be less than the cost of 2 dmpa 3 month injections we currently use cost was an important consideration for policy makers and providers but not so much for potential users another respondent said that a key issue is price an lai needs to compete i d say a unit price at less than us $4 per year the reasons for women s low concern about cost were varied women in some kenyan fgds were already paying for contraception and consequently appeared willing to pay us $4 or approximately 350 shillings per year for an lai for example women already paid 20 100 shillings us $0.24 $1.18 per cycle of pills and some iud or implant users reported paying 1 500 3 500 shillings and although injectables were free through the public sector kenyan women who obtained their method through a private sector clinic or were compelled to buy their injectable at a chemist or drug shop because of stockouts reported paying 150 300 shillings per injection clinics catering to higher income segments might charge even more according to several kenyan policy makers and program implementers in rwanda a few women who received their injectable at a private or ngo facility reported paying 700 1 000 francs us $1.16 $1.66 for a 3 month injectable and several women suggested that the 2 month injectable cost 1 500 francs per dose or 9 000 francs per year nevertheless most women reported that they would not pay us $4 approximately 2 400 francs for an lai given that all other methods could be obtained for free women in the more rural fgds were especially clear about the difficulty of paying for example one woman said it will be used by women with money i m not saying it is not going to be used but we have a lot of poor people there are some who may not even have 100 rwandan francs a month others might have that but they have a family you know child care may cost 5 000 or 6 000 francs a month on the other hand women in several fgds per country suggested that injectables can lead to cost savings especially due to reduced bleeding and therefore less need to purchase hygiene products several also suggested that fewer trips to the clinic for an lai would save money policy makers and providers also added that there could be systems savings due to lower client load discussion this research identified strong support for the development of a longer acting injectable contraceptive method for multiple reasons an lai would build on the existing popularity and high use of injectables reduce the travel time and number of clinic visits needed for users and increase convenience some of the findings about desired attributes have immediate implications for lai development activities for example there was little disagreement that a new lai should be highly effective the actual level of effectiveness needed to generate demand may vary somewhat but potential users and providers thought the lai would be acceptable as long as the method is perceived to be as effective as current injectable formulations additionally potential users and providers expressed strong preferences for a product that was delivered in a single injection rather than 2 injections was prepackaged and could be disposed after one use a prepackaged single use disposable lai was associated with less pain for injectable users higher levels of product safety and efficacy and greater efficiency for providers a potential longer acting injectable should be highly effective and delivered in a single prepackaged disposable system other tpp related information indicates the need for more tailored communication and counseling approaches to ensure acceptability and adherence within clinical trials and beyond for example while almost all participants agreed that an lai with few or no side effects and a rapid return to fertility was desirable they were also quick to recognize that most contraceptive methods had side effects some side effects especially heavier bleeding or loss of libido were viewed as less acceptable than others if lai use were associated with lengthy periods of such side effects it would offset one of the important perceived benefits of injectable use that of discretion or privacy by drawing attention to contraceptive use and potential disapproval from non supportive partners other side effects such as amenorrhea appeared tolerable or even appreciated as long as users and their providers had correct information about them similarly although different lengths of return to fertility might affect the types of women most likely to use an lai many participants anticipated that an 18 month return to fertility could be acceptable if women were properly counseled about it lengthy menstrual bleeding as a potential side effect of a longer acting injectable would offset the benefit of discreet use of injectables the study did identify widespread misunderstanding about contraception in general and injectables specifically among both providers and users in particular misperceptions about the effect of menstrual side effects on fertility as well as variation in and reasons for injectable related return to fertility should be addressed for existing injectables and new lai methods finally this assessment of tpp characteristics revealed some interesting country level differences serving as a reminder that product demand is likely to depend on the specific context in rwanda the potential for an lai to last 6 months was a welcome alternative to shorter acting methods such as condoms pills and 3 month injectables particularly in more rural areas where contraceptive resupply could be difficult in kenya where women appeared to access a wide variety of contraceptive options at a range of costs through a more diverse set of public private and or ngo clinics cost and the potential for service provision through community based workers were less important while concerns about ensuring the quality and control of lai delivery were greater limitations the study has several limitations we tried to reduce selection bias by approaching potential participants directly rather than having clinic staff identify and recruit them nevertheless because participants were drawn from health facilities our findings may not represent the opinions of women who do not access family planning services through clinics or who do not use contraception at all the study s qualitative design and small sample size prevent us from making recommendations about the composition of specific characteristics that would optimize demand however the in depth discussions about tpp characteristics from a range of stakeholders including policy makers program managers providers and potential lai users offer evidence of widespread support for the introduction of an lai as well as guidance about product characteristics that may be most or least important to target further quantitative research would be needed to determine the extent to which themes identified in this study can be generalized conclusion this study provides evidence
 of strong acceptability for an lai furthermore it provides some guidance related to product characteristics that should be prioritized in the development process while also serving as a reminder that eventual demand will be influenced by policy and service delivery decisions that affect potential users knowledge about access to and correct use of the method we extend our gratitude to the contraceptive clients providers and program and policy implementers who participated in this study we would like to thank the field teams in kenya and rwanda for their skillful efforts in recruiting participants conducting interviews and transcribing hours of audio recordings the kenya field team included lucy anziya jane musia benson mutuku and rosemary wangui in rwanda we thank the assistant field coordinator marie rose uwizeye and data collectors winifride mukamugenga mediatrice ntirushwa solange uwantege and regine uwizera this study was funded by the bill melinda gates foundation competing interests none declared peer reviewed references 1 united nations un department of economic and social affairs population division world contraceptive use 2011 new york un 2011 available from http www un org esa population publications contraceptive2011 contraceptive2011 htm 2 d arcangues c snow r injectable contraceptives rabe t runnebaum b editors fertility control update and trends berlin springer verlag 1999 p 121 149 3 lande r richey c expanding services for injectables popul rep k 2006 6 1 24 available from http www k4health org toolkits info publications expanding services injectables how family planning programs and providers 4 world health organization u s agency for international development family health international fhi community based health workers can safely and effectively administer injectable contraceptives conclusions from a technical consultation research triangle park nc fhi 2009 available from http www who int reproductivehealth publications family_planning who_cbd_brief en 5 kenya national bureau of statistics knbs icf macro kenya demographic and health survey 2008 09 calverton md knbs 2010 co published by icf macro available from http www measuredhs com pubs pdf fr229 fr229 pdf 6 national institute of statistics of rwanda nisr ministry of health icf macro measure dhs rwanda demographic and health survey 2010 preliminary report kigali rwanda nisr 2011 co published by icf macro available from http www measuredhs com pubs pdf pr7 pr7 pdf 7 westfall jm main ds barnard l continuation rates among injectable contraceptive users fam plann perspect 1996 28 6 275 277 10.2307 2136058 8959418 8 beksinska me rees hv smit j temporary discontinuation a compliance issue in injectable users contraception 2001 64 5 309 313 10.1016 s0010 7824 01 00268 2 11777492 9 ruminjo jk sekadde kigondu cb karanja jg rivera r nasution m nutley t comparative acceptability of combined and progestin only injectable contraceptives in kenya contraception 2005 72 2 138 145 10.1016 j contraception .2005.04.001 16022854 10 tolley e loza s kafafi l cummings s the impact of menstrual side effects on contraceptive discontinuation findings from a longitudinal study in cairo egypt int fam plan perspect 2005 31 01 15 23 15888405 11 murphy pa brixner d hormonal contraceptive discontinuation patterns according to formulation investigation of associations in an administrative claims database contraception 2008 77 4 257 263 10.1016 j contraception .2008.01.002 18342648 12 national collaborating centre for women s and children s health long acting reversible contraception london national institute for health and care excellence nice 2013 available from http www nice org uk nicemedia live 10974 29909 29909. pdf 13 lim sw rieder j coupey sm bijur pe depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use in inner city minority adolescents continuation rates and characteristics of long term users arch pediatr adolesc med 1999 153 10 1068 1072 10.1001 archpedi .153.10.1068 10520615 14 baumgartner jn morroni c mlobeli rd otterness c buga g chen m impact of a provider job aid intervention on injectable contraceptive continuation in south africa stud fam plann 2012 43 4 305 314 10.1111 j .1728 4465.2012.00328. x 23239249 15 ministry of public health and sanitation mophs kenya division of reproductive health national family planning guidelines for service providers updated to reflect the 2009 medical eligibility criteria of the world health organization nairobi mophs 2010 available from http www k4health org toolkits implants national family planning guidelines service providers kenya 16 world health organization department of reproductive health and research who rhr johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health center for communication programs ccp knowledge for health project family planning a global handbook for providers 2011 update baltimore ccp 2011 co published by who available from https www fphandbook org

Q background breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy among women worldwide 1 the status of the expression of the estrogen receptor er progesterone receptor pr and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 her2 are the most important prognostic markers for invasive breast cancer 2 triple negative breast cancer tnbc cells do not express er pr or her2 3 tnbc accounts for approximately 15 26 of breast cancer cases worldwide 4 7 the survival of patients with tnbc is shorter compared with that of patients with other breast cancer subtypes because of the unique genotype and clinical behavior of tnbc 3 tnbcs are more likely to be aggressive and have a higher tendency to metastasize to visceral organs patients with tnbc do not benefit from endocrine therapy or from anti her2 antibody therapy 8 moreover the chemosensitivity of tnbcs is limited despite clinical trials an efficacious treatment for patients with tnbc is not available 9 10 antiangiogenic agents such as a anti vascular endothelial growth factor vegf neutralizing antibody avastin bevacizumab and inhibitors of vegf receptor tyrosine kinase activity sorafenib and sunitinib are key components of front line combination regimens for the treatment of various human cancers 9 11 these agents are used to treat non small cell lung cancer renal cell cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma 12 14 and were used to treat metastatic breast cancers in preclinical and clinical studies 15 however these and other studies indicate that these therapies may have limited efficacy 16 18 although these agents inhibit the growth of primary tumors the responses are usually temporary and the overall survival of patients is only modestly increased 19 further when antiangiogenic agents are administered intermittently for example sunitinib 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off tumor regrowth is sometimes observed during drug free periods or upon termination of treatment 20 21 given the limited effect of such treatments several clinical trials of sunitinib or bevacizumab to treat breast cancer were terminated one study reported increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis after using vegf inhibitors or inactivating vegf gene expression in mouse models of cancer 22 these reports suggest that the rationale and prospects of antiangiogenic therapies for breast cancer treatment must be re evaluated because of this we asked two questions as follows 1 what is the mechanism of antiangiogenic treatment failure 2 is there any difference in the responses to anti vegf agents of patients with tnbc or non tnbc in 1999 maniotis et al reported the discovery of vasculogenic mimicry vm a vascularization of malignant tumors 23 vm channels are formed by tumor cells but not by endothelial cells vm occurs in many aggressive tumors such as melanoma inflammatory breast carcinoma prostate carcinoma ovarian carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors 24 28 tumors with vm are more aggressive and patients have a poorer prognosis than those without vm we proved that hypoxia induces vm and uncovered evidence that cancer stem cells cscs may play an important role in vm 29 30 moreover administration of antiangiogenic agents induces intratumoral hypoxia and hypoxia increases the number of cscs in cell lines derived from glioblastomas and breast cancers 31 based on these results we hypothesized that intratumoral hypoxia induced by antiangiogenic agents accelerates vm channel formation in tnbc by increasing the population of cscs which in turn causes tumor regrowth metastases and treatment failure using antiangiogenic agents this hypothesis is supported by the results of the present study that includes an analysis of human patients with tnbc and non tnbc as well as studies conducted in vivo and in vitro using mice that develop spontaneous tnbc and nude mice engrafted with human breast cancer cell lines with tnbc and non tnbc phenotypes results pathological and clinical features of tnbc the

whereas that of mcf 7 cells did not change figure 5 c and 5 d immunofluorescence analysis of cd133 expression by cells cultured in matrigel shows that cd133_ mda mb 231 cells survived hypoxia and formed a stem cell sphere moreover we detected cd133 in the tumor cells lining the vm channels but not in distantly located cells figure 5 e effects of twist1 on cd133 expression and vm like channel formation by breast cancer cells we used sirna techniques to investigate the role of twist1 in vasculogenic mimicry induced by tnbcs and the generation of cd133_ cells under hypoxia twist1 expression was inhibited or increased in mda mb 231 transfected with a twist1 sirna and mcf 7 cells transfected with twist1 transfected mda mb 231 cells did not form vm like channels under normoxia hypoxia or reoxygenation and cd133 expression was inhibited as well figure 6 mcf 7 cells that expressed higher levels of twist1 formed vm channels under conditions of normoxia and reoxygenation moreover the tumor cells lining the vm channels expressed cd133 figure 6 figure 6 effects of twist1 levels on cd133 expression and vm like channel formation by breast cancer cells mda mb 231 cells did not form vm like channels when twist1 expression was inhibited under conditions of normoxia hypoxia and reoxygenation and cd133 expression was inhibited as well when twist1 expression was up regulated mcf 7 cells formed vm channels under conditions of normoxia and reoxygenation moreover the tumor cells that lined the vm channels were cd133_ the error bar 100 m and the error bar indicates the sd discussion vasculogenic mimicry occurs in over 10 tumor types 23 32 that are characterized as highly aggressive poorly differentiated and highly metastatic 32 33 therefore patients with tumors characterized by vasculogenic mimicry have poor outcomes compared with those without vm 24 compared with other tumors tnbcs are larger higher grade more aggressive and they present with lymph node involvement 4 7 34 we found that vm occurs more frequently in patients with tnbc compared with those with non tnbc which strongly supports the conclusion that vm indicates poor prognosis hendrix et al proposed that tumor cells with embryonic phenotypes are highly plastic and form vm channels 33 the genes that express proteins that contribute to the formation of vm channels are specifically expressed by endothelial and hematopoietic stem cells
 35 36 recent reports indicate that cscs may be involved in vm in glioblastomas breast cancers and hepatocellular carcinomas 30 37 hepatocellular carcinoma cells that form vm channels express csc markers such as sox2 and oct4 sun bc et al unpublished observations glioma cancer stem cells enriched in the human glioblastoma cell line u87 form vm channels in xenograft transplantation 37 analysis of the gene expression profiles of 587 patients with tnbc shows enrichment of markers specific for stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells 38 the epithelial to mesenchymal transition emt is important in vm moreover genes encoding proteins associated with the emt are expressed at high levels in this population of patients 39 moreover these results suggest that the gene expression fingerprint of tnbc determines the ability of tnbcs to form vm more efficiently compared with non tnbcs bevacizumab and sunitinib in combination with cytotoxic drugs were administered in phase iii trials of patients with metastatic breast cancer and bevacizumab was evaluated for treating patients with early stage breast cancer as a neoadjuvant 40 the failures of these trials recently provoked several debates regarding the future applications of anti vegf agents in breast cancer 20 41 aside from the failure of anti vegf agents to treat breast cancer the results of clinical and preclinical research show that they have limited efficacy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma rectal cancer and glioblastoma 14 these treatment failures may be explained as follows 16 19 i some breast cancers are highly angiogenic and express low levels of vegf ii numerous proangiogenic growth factors such as plgf pdgfbb and bfgf are present and can be up regulated to drive angiogenesis when the vegf pathway is inhibited 10 and iii antiangiogenic therapy can increase tumor hypoxia which induces an increase in hif 1 expression to levels sufficient to activate genes that encode proteins required for the growth invasion and metastasis in the present study sunitinib was administered to ta2 mice engrafted with tumors of the tn phenotype that were derived from ta2 spontaneous breast cancers 42 the growth of primary tumors and metastases were typically inhibited by sunitinib treatment and the survival of the treated mice increased from 40 to 100 however the mice suffered from tumor regrowth and metastases when treatment was suspended which decreased to those of the control group our previous study reveals three stages of tumor microcirculation in melanomas 32 vm channels mosaic blood vessels and endothelial vessels coexist in a malignant tumor and can transform into each other by changes in the tumor microenvironment 29 43 because vm occurs in tnbc we investigated the microcirculation patterns of the sunitinib treated tumors and observed numerous vm channels when endothelial vessels were inhibited by sunitinib after discontinuing treatment the number of endothelial vessels increased and were linked to the vm channels the vegf signaling pathway is essential in endothelial cell dependent angiogenesis however vm is independent of vegf 32 for example when endothelial vessels are blocked by anti vegf agents vm can be triggered to provide blood to promote tumor growth and metastasis moreover vm is responsible for regenerating the endothelial vessels when treatment is discontinued in this study these results implicate vm in the failure of standard antiangiogenic therapy to kill aggressive tumors therefore devising strategies that combine standard vegf targeted therapies or an endothelium dependent drug with vm targeted therapies is attracting considerable interest 44 a hypoxic tumor microenvironment is the most important inducer of vm 28 29 39 consistent with these findings we show here that sunitinib inhibited endothelial vessels produced additional hypoxic areas in tnbc bearing ta2 mice and increased the number of vm channels these results are consistent with our previous finding that hypoxia of the ischemic back limb promotes vm in the b16 melanoma mouse model we also found that cocl_2 induced hypoxia increased the number of vm like channels of mda mb 231 cells cultured in matrigel in the present study the mechanism responsible for the effects of hypoxia on vm is unknown the downstream effectors of hif 1 are associated with angiogenesis cell proliferation cell survival and glucose iron metabolism hypoxia is linked to increased numbers of cscs in glioblastoma and breast cancer and cscs are involved in tumor angiogenesis and vm 31 45 46 the breast cancer cells of ta2 mice expressed increased levels of cd133 under hypoxia after sunitinib treatment further hypoxia induced an increase in the population of cd133_ mda mb 231 cells in vivo moreover stem cells that formed spheres survived and expressed cd133 under hypoxia only the cd133_ cells formed vm channels in matrigel after reoxygenation suggesting that hypoxia accelerates vm by stimulating the csc population we found that the emt factor twist1 induced the expression of ve cadherin to promote vm in hepatocellular carcinoma 28 hypoxia induces an emt like phenotype in cancer cells 47 and hif 1 regulates the expression of twist1 by binding directly to the hypoxia response element hre in the proximal promoter of twist1 emt can induce stem cell generation by normal and tumor cells 48 49 we show here that mda mb 231 cells with up regulated twist1 expression increased the csc population after reoxygenation therefore more vm channels were generated by cells cultured in matrigel hypoxia did not significantly affect the csc population in cultures of mcf 7 cells and twist1 expression was down regulated after reoxygenation inhibiting twist1 expression by mda mb 231 cells caused the loss of vm channels in matrigel and decreased the number of cd133_ cells in hypoxic cultures mcf 7 cells that expressed twist1 gained the ability to form vm channels and generate cd133_ cells these results highlight the complexity of the mechanism that regulates the emt and the biology of cscs human mammary epithelial cells are transformed by twist1 and snail and they exhibit the characteristics of cscs including the formation of mammospheres colonies in soft agar and tumors in vivo 49 for example borgna et al found that mcf 7 cells gain mesenchymal features by enriching for cscs in short term mammosphere culture 50 whether the emt regulates cscs or cscs regulate the emt is unknown therefore hypoxia induced by sunitinib accelerates vm by increasing twsit1 expression and the population of cscs in tnbc this finding may explain the inefficacy of antiangiogenic agents in certain breast cancers most important twist1 and related signal transduction pathways may serve as targets for treating tnbc conclusions sunitinib induced hypoxia in tnbcs and twist1 expression induced by hypoxia accelerated vm by increasing the size of the population of cd133_ cells vm was responsible for the regrowth

Q 1 introduction a device capable of mimicking the olfactory discrimination mechanism is useful to many industries not only for the detection of particular gases but also for the quality control evaluation of mixtures in the food and beverage industries and for environmental monitoring gas sensors are widely used to detect and control a variety of harmful gases thereby protecting both the atmospheric environment and human welfare semiconducting metal oxides have been extensively used as sensing materials resistance changes in oxide based semiconductor gas sensors are used to monitor reducing toxic and inflammable gases such as nh_3 no_2 h_2 and co zinc oxide zno is a well known functional n type semiconductor of the ii vi group a technologically important low cost and environmentally friendly semiconductor material and one of the most promising candidates for detecting various gases this semiconductor has several favorable properties including good transparency high electron mobility wide bandgap and strong room temperature luminescence furthermore zno is a unique material possessing such properties as semiconductivity piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity because of its versatility wide band gap wurtzite phase zno has been used in applications such as blue and ultraviolet light emitters transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays solar cell windows gas sensors photovoltaic devices light emitting diodes thin film transistors pyroelectric sensors surface acoustic wave saw devices and film bulk acoustic resonators fbars zno has been extensively used as a gas sensing material due to its high conduction electron mobility and good chemical and thermal stability when subjected to the operating conditions required in sensors the sensing mechanism of zno is a surface controlled type in which the grain size defects and oxygen adsorption quantities play important roles in sensing response it is obvious that the sensitivity and the response time of zno based sensors strongly depend on their size specific surface area and morphology 1 4 moreover gas sensors based on zno nanobelts synthesized by rf sputtering had been investigated with a view to sensing h_2 no_2 and hydrocarbon at different operating temperatures 5 a gas sensor was fabricated from the as prepared zno hollow spheres and tested to different concentrations of nh_3 and no_2 at different operating temperatures 6 the results showed that the zno hollow sphere sensor exhibited extremely different sensing behaviors to nh_3 and no_2 a zinc oxide nanorod based surface acoustic wave sensor for hydrogen h_2 gas has been developed and investigated 7 the zno nanorods were deposited onto a layered zno 64 yx linbo_3 substrate using a liquid solution method the study showed that the sensor responded with highest frequency shift at 265 c furthermore electronically contacted nanorods or nanotube arrays were used as gas sensors an adsorbate modified either the impedance or the fermi level of the array enabling detection 8 the arrays demonstrated the i v curves of a schottky diode that was formed using a metal semiconductor junction with rectifying characteristics the study showed that nanostructured schottky diodes had a functionally different response characteristic of the large electric field induced by the size scale of the array zno films have been synthesized by numerous methods such as metal organic chemical vapor deposition molecular beam epitaxy magnetron sputtering pulsed laser deposition microwave assisted hydrothermal processes atomic layer deposition spray pyrolysis filtered cathodic vacuum arc technique sol gel process aerosol and liquid phase deposition technique 9 16 because nanostructures with high surface area and surface accessibility can significantly improve gas sensing properties in this study an aerosol deposition ad process was used to grow porous zno films with a high surface to volume ratio for accelerating the processes and applications of the film to gas sensors moreover the gas sensor was focused on the detection of carbon monoxide co as co gas is one of the most dangerous gases formed whenever incomplete combustion of carbonaceous products occurs typically in automobile exhausts forest fires and house fires the ad method is based on impact adhesion of ultra fine particles for forming and micro pattering ceramic layers it is a form of the gas deposition method or jet printing method without requiring vaporization of materials in the ad ceramic films are prepared by ejecting an aerosol mixture of ultra fine ceramic particles and gas from the nozzle onto substrates during the ad operation submicron ceramic particles are accelerated by gas flow in the nozzle up to a velocity of several hundred meters per second as they are sprayed onto substrates the ad provides many advantages for producing films in the range of 1 100 m thickness with a high deposition rate low deposition temperature large scale production and low cost 17 18 moreover the ad method can achieve fine patterning 19 20 and fabricate a dense structure through the reduction of crystallite size by fracture or plastic deformation at room temperature 17 18 in the present study an attempt was made to deposit a porous zno film with a high surface to volume ratio onto silicon substrates for intended use as a co gas sensor this was done using the ad rapid process to accelerate the deposition process of the zno film for its application as a gas sensor 2 experimental procedure 2.1 deposition of porous zno films the ad apparatus was comprised of two vacuum chambers connected by a gas pipe the first chamber acted as the deposition chamber for the formation of films it included a nozzle a motion platform and a substrate with its heating system the chamber was evacuated during the deposition process using a rotary vacuum pump with a dust collection system the second chamber acted as the aerosol chamber to generate ceramic aerosol it held a carrier gas system a filter and a vibration system for mixing the ceramic powder and the carrier gas the ceramic aerosol in the aerosol chamber was delivered to the deposition chamber due to the pressure difference between the two chambers the ceramic powder flowed through a nozzle and was deposited onto the substrates the velocities of the ceramic aerosol were controlled by a mass flow controller the schematic diagram of the ad apparatus is shown in figure 1 table 1 shows the deposition parameters used for the ad method the zno powder was provided by top nano technology co ltd of new taipei taiwan the geometry and material properties of the starting zno powder are shown in table 2 high moisture content in the ceramic powder is responsible for a reduction in film quality because agglomerated particles serve as a cushion to absorb kinetic energy when powders impact against substrates resulting in the formation of compacted powders hence a pre treatment of the zno starting powder was carried out to improve the zno film quality by applying heat at 150 c for 1 h using an oven a zno film with a thickness of about 1 m was deposited onto the silicon substrate by the ad at room temperature employing various process parameters furthermore the laser annealing system lee 25 laser life taipei taiwan using continuous wave co_2 laser irradiation with a wavelength of 10.6 m power of 25 w and beam diameter of 2 mm was adopted for the zno film annealing in a n_2 atmosphere the laser annealing parameters comprised the movement velocity of the laser head in the x y plane distance between substrates and laser head laser power adjustment ambient gas and flow rate as shown in table 3 the thickness of the zno films was further probed by a surface analyzer et 4000ak kosaka tokyo japan the morphological properties were examined using scanning electron microscopy sem 2.2 fabrication of zno gas sensors the zno gas sensor is comprised of a substrate with a silicon nitride layer a heater pt ti a pair of comb like electrodes and a sensing porous zno film as shown schematically in figure 2 the width of the signal electrodes and heater was 50 m with a distance of 30 m maintained between the electrodes and the heater the process flow of the zno gas sensor was divided into several steps as follows a silicon wafer with specifications of 100 p type double side polished and a resistivity of 1 10 o cm was used as the substrate supporting the zno gas sensor as shown in figure 3a a low stress silicon nitride layer with a thickness of 1 m was deposited on both sides of the substrate by lpcvd to be used as a thermal and electrical isolation layer the pair of comb like electrodes were deposited on the substrate by electron beam e beam evaporation as shown in figure 3b and patterned by photolithography as shown in figure 3c with wet etching as shown in figure 3d these electrodes comprised a 100 nm thick gold layer and a 10 nm thick chromium adhesion layer in addition the heater was patterned by photolithography as shown in figure 3e and deposited on the substrate by electron beam e beam evaporation as shown in figure 3f a lift off process was used to achieve the heater process as shown in figure 3g the heater comprised a 100 nm thick platinum layer and a 10 nm thick titanium adhesion layer the next step was to deposit the zno films about 1 m in thickness by the ad and pattern these using the shadow mask method as shown in figure 3h the zno film promoted by laser annealing ensued as shown in figure 3i the fabricated zno gas sensor is shown in figure 4 the porous zno architectures produced by ad were characterized by sem as depicted in figure 5 2.3 gas sensing property measurements the electrical and co gas sensing properties of the fabricated gas sensing elements were measured by a lcr meter attached to a pair of comb like electrodes an agilent e4980a system formed a computer controlled gas sensing characterization
 system using a flow through method shown schematically in figure 6 this automatic measurement of the gas sensing system was achieved primarily using an ni labview system consisting of a ni pxie 1082 case a ni pxie 8135 controller a ni pxie 6366 data acquisition card and ni labview 2012 software the gas sensors were placed in a sealed quartz tube acting as an airtight chamber possessing an inlet an outlet and electrical feed through carrier gas dry air and target gas co with n_2 were loaded into the sealed chamber through the inlet port while the gases automatically exited the outlet port due to the difference in pressure between the interior and exterior of the chamber during the whole measurement dry air was continuously introduced into the chamber at a flow rate of 500 sccm the target gas co at an initial concentration of 5000 ppm with nitrogen balance and coordination was further diluted in dry air flow rate of 500 sccm for controlling the co gas concentration the operating temperature was controlled using a micro heater consisting of platinum and titanium layers integrated within the zno gas sensor 3 results and discussion the phase and structural analysis of the aerosol deposited zno films was carried out by xrd and is shown in figure 7 the xrd pattern exhibited typical peaks at 2 31.80 34.60 36.20 47.50 56.60 62.90 and 67.90 belonging to the reflection of 100 002 101 102 110 103 and 112 of the wurtzite hexagonal zno respectively with the lattice constants of a 0.325 nm and c 0.521 nm jcpds card no 36 1451 the x ray diffractogram indicated the growth of the zno film treated by laser annealing along the seven planes of orientations 100 002 101 102 110 103 and 112 though prominent growth occurred along 100 002 and 101 the most preferential growth was observed along the 002 plane with the fwhm of 0.26 the co gas sensing properties of the porous zno film gas sensors were measured by using various co gas concentrations the gas sensing mechanism of the semiconducting metal oxide gas sensors is based on variations in electrical resistance or conductance due to gas adsorption and desorption on the sensor surface when the zno gas sensors are exposed to air oxygen molecules from the ambient air adsorb on the exposed zno surface to form chemisorbed oxygen anions o_2 _ o_ or o_2 depending on the operating temperature by capturing electrons from the zno conduction band this results in the formation of a depletion layer known as the space charge layer on the surface of the zno sensing material this induces an increase in the resistance of the sensing materials the reactions under various operating temperatures can be described as follows 1 o2 e o2 2 o2 2e 2o 3 o2 4e 2o2 when the zno gas sensors are exposed in a co environment at a moderate temperature the adsorbed co gas reacts with the chemisorbed oxygen anions on the zno surface resulting in co_2 molecules and the release of electrons back into the conduction band this leads to an increase in the concentration of electrons the resistivity of the zno films decreases for detecting the co gas the reactions under various operating temperatures can be described as follows 4 2co o2 2co2 e 5 co o co2 e 6 co o2 co2 2e because zno is a low conductive semiconductor material oxygen ion sorption and the transfer of electrons is not possible at room temperature the dynamic resistance transients with various tested temperatures and co concentrations are depicted in figure 8 the initial resistance of the zno gas sensor in dry air was high whereas its resistance decreased abruptly when it was exposed to co gas the resistance of the zno gas sensor decreased after each co gas injection cycle this exhibits n type semiconducting behavior of the zno material and its response and recovery process can be established by comparing the resistance of the zno nano architectures in different ambiences co is a well known reducing gas that can provide electrons to n type zno semiconducting nano architectures the resistance variation between the injection cycles of co and dry air increased with increasing test temperatures and co concentrations moreover the lower initial resistance at higher temperatures was also ascribed to the semiconducting property of the zno material it was clearly seen that the response characteristics of the sensor depended on the operating temperature the sensitivity s_co of the porous zno gas sensors is defined as a ratio of the change in resistance between samples exposed in dry air and in co gas 7 sco ra rco rawhere r_a is the resistance of the samples measured in air and r_co is the resistance of the samples measured in co gas the resistance is measured between the pair of comb like electrodes via the zno film deposited by the ad method figure 9 shows the relationship between co concentrations and sensitivity observed for the gas sensors at various operating temperatures the sensitivity of the sensors increased as co concentrations and operating temperatures increased it is well known that the sensitivity of the sensor based on sensing oxides was mainly determined by the interactions between the target gas and the sensing surface furthermore it can ensure that the surface area of the sensing materials is greater and the stronger interaction and the higher response can be expected 4 the zno nanoarchitectures fabricated by the ad are shown in figure 5 with interlaced connected network they maintained the high surface area and efficiently avoided the agglomerated configuration resulting in an excellent response this architecture presented a stacked structure with zno nanosheets moreover some nanoprotrusions were attached onto the zno nanosheets and they were produced by laser annealing to increase the sensing surface the response and recovery time are important characteristics for appraising gas sensors and they determined the surface accessibility of the sensing framework furthermore the response time included the gas diffusion toward the sensing surface for reacting with chemisorbed oxygen ions and the subsequent re oxidation process of the sensing surface to yield oxygen species the response and recovery time were defined as the time required for the gas sensor to achieve 90 of the total resistance change in the case adsorption and desorption respectively the response and the recovery time were related to operating temperatures they shrank to increase the operating temperature figure 10 shows the relationship between co concentrations and the response and recovery time for the gas sensors at a higher operating temperature of 180 c the response time was smaller than the recovery time at each co concentration this was effective for practical application because the gas sensors generally readied in an ambiance of dry air therefore a short response time was useful for detecting the variation of co concentrations the response time ranged from 24 s to 45 s whereas the recovery time ranged from 55 s to 110 s under co concentrations varying from 1000 ppm to 100 ppm furthermore the zno gas sensor for co gas sensing properties was estimated by a circulation of co injection about 5 min and an air ambiance about 5 min the resistance curve was like to a triangle shape while the zno gas sensor worked at the lower operating temperature this meant that the total resistance change of the zno film needed more time although the response and recovery time for observing the total resistance change of the zno film increased at the lower operating temperature the sensitivity of the zno gas sensor at the lower operating temperature was still ponderable the possible model for clarifying the gas sensing mechanism of the nanorods film gas sensors had been demonstrated 21 the three types of junctions point junction cross junction and block junction formed the potential barriers and blocked electrons percolating in zno nanorods network moreover the potential barrier of the point junction formed by the two depletion layers of the two contact nanorods was more significantly modified upon exposure to the target gas compared with that of the block and the cross junction in the present study the zno nanoarchitecture deposited by the ad was a porous zno film with a stacked structure the randomly stacked zno film possessed a larger surface area for reacting to co gas and absorbing more co gas furthermore the proposed zno film presented more junctions between nanosheets for enhancing the resistance variation and increasing the surface accessibility therefore the zno film grown by the ad using pure zno powder results in a low cost rapid convenient large scale and simple process for fabricating gas sensing devices 4 conclusions the rapid ad process is proposed for application to gas sensors this may minimize production costs reduce the necessity of additional post assembly processes and diminish the scope of fabrication processes zinc oxide zno is an environmentally friendly material which can be used in producing green products and devices the ad process was successfully used to accelerate the application of zno films onto co gas sensing devices the resulting co gas sensor demonstrated improved performance yet it can still be fabricated more quickly and at a lower cost the authors are thankful for the

Q 1 introduction at present advances in chemical sensing technology 1 have made it applicable to maintain a wireless network of inexpensive and reliable chemical sensors for environment monitoring an important application of such a wsn is csl which consists of not only measuring the concentration of the objective chemical substance but also locating the chemical source using the concentration measurements designing an efficient csl method may greatly reduce both human injuries and financial losses 2 compared with mobile sensors a static wsn can cover a large area at a faster speed this advantage is more remarkable when the target area constrains the mobility of the mobile sensors for example in the case of locating the source of a smoke cloud at the initial stage of a potential conflagration in a mountain a wsn can be rapidly self organized by a large number of sensor nodes which are deployed from a plane flying over the cloud while the way of existing mobile sensors would be hindered due to the complicated obstacles however the working time of wsn would be limited if heavy communication burdens are imposed since the sensor nodes are mainly powered up by batteries which cannot be easily charged on site this problem makes the power consumption a key factor during the design of applications based on wsns to save the limited power the most commonly used method is to reduce the power consumed by wireless communication specifically this target can be realized by utilizing distributed methods which avoid transmitting raw measurements to the sink node moreover the robustness of the distributed method is better than the centralized one i e for distributed methods any single node having problem does not influence the whole result the problem of csl using a network of chemical sensors has been intensively investigated 3 10 since the seminal work of nehorai et al 11 among these works least squares estimation lse based methods require no statistical assumptions about the measurement errors since the estimate is chosen to provide a best fit to the observed measurements in a deterministic sense 12 13 nevertheless the objective function of lse based csl using wsn has multiple local optima and saddle points thus the traditionally used search techniques may converge locally to a suboptimal solution matthes et al 4 proposed a superior unimodal objective function which can largely reduce the difficulty of searching the single maximum located at the real source location however the raw concentration measurements should be gathered together in order to calculate the objective function this process of gathering the raw measurements at the sink node conflicts with the scheme of distributed methods this paper proposes a distributed global convergent lse method for solving the problem of csl using wsns the problem of minimizing the objective function of lse based csl using wsns i e the sum of squared measurement errors is decomposed into multiple sub problems of minimizing individual summands each of which is associated with the information of an individual sensor node and thus can be solved locally on the associated sensor node aiming to minimize an individual summand we derive a set of probable source locations by substituting the noisy measurement to the concentration distribution model an estimate of the source location is locally determined from each of the location sets by empirically maximizing the probability of being the real source location based on the prior information about the source location then the problem of csl using a wsn can be solved by comprehensively incorporating the information of these local estimates into a global estimate we consider a convex combination of these local estimates as the global estimate of the source location the convex combination of these local estimates which are distributed on individual sensor nodes is realized in a distributed manner using the distributed average consensus algorithm proposed in 14 finally the above mentioned process repeats iteratively until the termination condition is satisfied and the global estimate is considered as the prior information about the source location for determining the local estimates at the next iteration the proposed method was assessed in both simulations and real experiments including the case of locating a remote chemical source the rest of this paper is organized as follows the chemical concentration distribution model the sensor source distance function and the measurement model are described in section 2 the dlse method for csl using wsn is proposed in section 3 the results of numerical simulations and real experiments are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively some concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 formulation and preliminaries in this section the advection diffusion chemical concentration distribution model is introduced and then the distance between the unknown source and the sensor node is represented as a function of their relative angle and the theoretical concentration at the sensor node location finally the concentration measurement model of the sensor nodes in the wsn is presented 2.1 chemical concentration distribution model the advection diffusion model proposed in 15 is adopted in this paper in the theory of eddy diffusion in the atmosphere the diffusion rate at a certain point under each pressure level is parameterized by the eddy diffusivity k cm_2 s the concentration of the chemical substance c g ml can reach a steady state in a homogeneous wind field in which the eddy diffusivity is the same at every point 15 as shown in figure 1 the continuous chemical source located at point o is releasing at a rate q g s the released chemical substance is advected by a homogeneous wind 16 the speed of which is v cm s along the positive x axis the sensor which is represented by point p at x y z lies in the plume caused by the chemical source the steady concentration at the point x y z satisfies 1 v c x k 2c the concentration distribution is symmetry about the x axis due to the homogenous flow and then equation 1 becomes 2 vcos d vsind  c kd2 d d2 c d 1sin  sin c  where  is the angle between op and ox 15 considering that the concentrations at the source location and the point extremely far away from the source i e d approximately equal and zero respectively then the solution of equation 2 is 3 c x y z q4kdexp vd 1 cos 2k in the case studied here the chemical source and the sensor nodes are situated on an impenetrable floor to analyze the concentration distribution on the floor we first suppose that the chemical source is placed at 0 0 h since no chemical matters can diffuse through the impenetrable floor the concentration at p can be calculated using the method of mirror images 17 as follows 4 c x y z q4kd exp vd 1 cos 2k q4kd exp vd 1 cos 2k where d x2 y2 z h 2 and d x2 y2 z h 2 then substituting h 0 and z 0 into equation 4 for the concentration in our case the concentration at p is given by 5 c x y q2kdexp vd 1 cos 2k more generally when the chemical source is located at another point x _0 y _0 in the 2 dimensional coordinate system the associated distance will be d x x0 2 y y0 2 to emphasize the importance of the node locations in determining the source location the location of the chemical source is transferred into the polar coordinate system in which the sensor location p is taken as the origin as shown in figure 1c then the coordinate x _0 y _0 is expressed as 6 x0 x dcosy0 y dsinwhere  0 2 is the angle from the positive x axis to the broken line pointing from the measuring location to the source the relationship between  and  is shown in figure 1b obviously    and equation 5 becomes 7 c x y q2kdexp vd 1 cos   2k q2kdexp vd 1 cos 2k the advection diffusion model introduced above was also referred to as robert s model in 18 some of other studies based on this model can be found in 4 17 19 20 2.2 deriving the sensor source distance function based on the concentration distribution model in equation 7 given the concentration c flow speed v and the parameters k and q the distance between the chemical source and the sensor node can be expressed as a function of  by reverse derivation first applying the equation cos 2cos22 2sin22 to equation 7 we get 8 c q2k d exp vdcos22k then moving the denominator in the right hand side of equation 8 to the left hand side and multiplying both sides with vcos2  2 kc we obtain 9 vdcos22kexp vdcos22k vqcos222k2c based on the principle branch of the lambert w function i e w _0 s s 0 which satisfies w _0 s exp w _0 s s s 0 21 when   equation 9 can be rewritten as 10 vdcos22k w0 vqcos222k2c finally the sensor source distance d can be represented as follows 11 d q2kc  kvcos22w0 vqcos222k2c others since the principle branch of the lambert w function is single valued and monotonically increasing according to equation 11 d is inversely proportional to c when other variables are kept constant 2.3 measurement model suppose there is a wsn that consists of n chemical sensor nodes randomly deployed at known global coordinates x _i x_i y_i i 1 n on the same 2 dimensional field as the chemical source deployed at x _0 x_0 y_0 note that the boldface lowercase letter denotes the coordinate vector of a sensor node as well as the sensor node itself which is easy to be distinguished in the rest of this paper after the steady state of concentration distribution is reached the measurements z_i i 1 n at the same sampling time can be formulated as 12 zi ci eiwhere c_i represents the theoretical concentration at the location of x _i e_i stands for the measurement error which is mainly comprised of the errors caused by the uncontrollable drift of the sensors and the sensors response to foreign substances due to the poor selectivity of the commonly used chemical sensors 2 typically it can be considered that the error terms for
 all the sensor nodes at the same sampling time satisfies the normal distribution with a positive mean value 11 due to the relatively small variance of the normal distribution of e_i i 1 n the value of z_i i 1 n can roughly represent its signal to noise ratio snr i e z_i e_i 1 6 7 for a better localization performance a measurement threshold is set to eliminate the measurements with comparatively low snrs the nodes with measurements that are smaller than the threshold z_th will be scheduled to hibernate and the remaining l l n nodes will participate in the localization 3 distributed least squares estimation method for csl using wsn in the lse based csl using a wsn the objective function to be minimized is the sum of squares of the l participating scattered sensor nodes measurement errors 22 which is as follows 13 obj x0 i 1l zi ci x0 2 x0 2where z_i i 1 l and c_i x _0 i 1 l are known measurements and unknown theoretical concentration since x _0 is unknown during the localization respectively by varying the location of x _0 in its domain i e x _0 _2 the distribution of this objective function can be obtained the logarithm of this distribution is illustrated in figure 2 there is a global minimum located at the actual source location while there are some local minima near the global minimum as well as some saddle points around the local maxima as shown in figure 2 there is a global minimum located at the actual source location it is straightforward that the objective function in equation 13 would achieve its global minimum when the l summands i e z_i c_i x _0 _2 reach their minima simultaneously the fact that z_i c_i x _0 _2 is irrelevant to all the sensor nodes except x _i motivates the idea of designing a local estimation of the source location which is aiming to minimize z_i c_i x _0 _2 for x _i after the estimates of these local estimations are achieved they are convexly combined to form the global estimate by using an average consensus algorithm the overall scheme of the proposed method is given in figure 3 in which the sub processes are detailed in the following subsections 3.1 local estimation of the source location in section 2 the location of the chemical source has been transformed into the polar coordinate system in which the location of sensor node is taken as the origin according to equation 11 when   the coordinates of the source location can be further expressed as functions of  as follows 14 x0 x k 1 tan22 vw0 vqcos222k2c y0 y 2kvtan2w0 vqcos222k2c   for the case that   the source location is x0 y0 x q2kc y however the calculation of equation 14 involves determining the theoretical concentration c which is impossible to be obtained due to the unknown source location since e_i i 1 l are minor compared with c_i i 1 l the measurement z_i i 1 l can be considered as an approximate estimate of c_i i 1 l then by substituting z_i for c in equation 14 and changing  in its domain 0 2 we can determine a set of points which are approximate estimates of the source location the point set corresponding to z_i i 1 l is denoted by si x0i i 1 l in the context of probabilistic inference the points in si x0i i 1 l can be considered as the probable source locations inferred based on z_i i 1 l compared with the domain of x _0 i e x _0 _2 the set si x0i i 1 l is substantially refined and thus is referred to as the refined sample space i e the set of all possible results for the subsequent local estimation on x _i i 1 l after z_i is substituted for c equation 14 becomes an equation set with a single unknown  whose domain is 0 2 therefore as shown in figure 4 the problem of estimating x _0 can be transformed to another problem of estimating the angle of the vector pointing from x _i to x _0 i e 0i although it is difficult to assign a rigorous theoretical probability of being the actual source location to each point in s_i i 1 l if a predictive location of the source exists it can be empirically considered that the point with the same polar angle as the predictive location has the largest probability of being the actual source location among all the points in s_i i 1 l inspired by the process of iterative estimation the global estimate x k 1 is considered as the prior information predictive location of the source for the local estimations at the k th iteration of localization let us define  k as the angle between the vector x k 1 x _i and the positive direction of the polar axis then a local estimate of the source location can be considered as 15 x 0i k x0i zi k  i k i 1 l  i k angle x 0 k 1 xi where x0i zi k  i k denotes an estimate of the source location determined by  _i k from the refined sample space si x0i i 1 l calculated using z_i k this process of local estimation can be considered as a quasi maximum a posterior estimation because the maximum posterior probability is determined empirically rather than theoretically based on the location of x _0 k 1 note that at the beginning of the localization there is no prior information about the source location to start the localization an initial point must be set as the prior information for the first iteration of localization since the initial point has little influence on the localization performance see section 4.3 it can be randomly initialized 3.2 combining the local estimates to form the global estimate section 3.1 presents a framework for the local estimation of the chemical source location based on the prior information about the predictive location of the source however it does not detail how this prior information is achieved and how it is accessible to the participating scattered sensor nodes moreover the individual local estimates can only minimize an individual summand of the objective function in equation 13 with the maximum probability thus to comprehensively consider all the summands of the objective function in equation 13 these local estimates are combined to form a global estimate which serves as the prior information about the source location at the next iteration of localization 3.2.1 convex combination of the local estimates a convex combination of the local estimates at the k th iteration of localization i e x 0i k is considered as the k th global estimate x _0 k 16 x 0 k i 1lwi k x 0i k where w_i k satisfies i 1lwi k 1 and w_i k 0 rendering the combination in equation 16 as convex x 0i k is calculated using equation 15 to set reasonable weights for the local estimates in equation 16 let us consider the positional relationship between x _0 and the points in s_i i 1 l from which the local estimates are selected when the different contaminated measurements z_i i 1 l are substituted for c in equation 14 the size of the associated ovals formed by the points in different refined sample spaces i e s_i i 1 l are different the oval generated by substituting a larger z_i for c in equation 14 is smaller than that generated using a smaller z_i this is mainly because d will decrease if c increases and other parameters are kept constant according to equation 11 moreover as shown in figure 5 the points on a smaller oval are generally closer to x _0 than those on a bigger oval therefore it is reasonable to construct a direct proportion between w_i k and z_i k to make the sequence of x _0 k approach x _0 the weights w_i k are tentatively set as the proportion of z_i k in the sum of all the l measurements as in equation 17 and achieve good performance in the results presented in sections 4 and 5 17 wi k zi k j 1lzj k i 1 l 3.2.2 distributed average consensus algorithm it is readily seen that there are two individual accumulating operators in equation 16 and equation 17 moreover the accumulating results i e x _0 k and the denominator in equation 17 should be accessible to all the participating scattered sensor nodes the centralized processing method in which a fusion center gathers the summands from and then transmits the sum back to all the sensor nodes is not power efficient for wsn and thus is avoided in this paper since the sum can be considered as the product of the amount and the average of the summands the process of accumulation can be transformed to an averaging process and an additional multiplication between the amount and the associated average as follows 18 i 1lfi 0 l avg fi 0 i 1 l where avg means the averaging operator and f_i _0 i 1 l are the initial states of the values to be averaged for example in the case of calculating equation 16 fi 0 wi k x 0i k i 1 l then the distributed average consensus algorithm in 14 can be used to calculate the averaging term in equation 18 which is involved in the convex combination of local estimates twice i e in calculating equations 16 and 17 the distributed average consensus algorithm means that only local communications within the neighboring set of each participating scattered sensor node are needed during the averaging procedure 23 the steps of adopting this algorithm to our specific problem are elaborated as follows step 1 generate the corresponding graph and the laplacian matrix suppose each participating scattered sensor node can only communicate with the sensor nodes within its neighboring range a graph describing the corresponding network architecture is generated in the generated graph there is an edge between two nodes which can communicate with each other then the laplacian matrix denoted by l of the graph is calculated as l aa_t where a is the incidence matrix of the graph since a is a matrix with l rows and g columns where g is the number of edges in the graph l is a l dimensional square matrix for example as shown in figure 6 there are l 18 vertexes and g 32 edges in the graph corresponding to the mesh architecture in figure 1d so the corresponding laplacian matrix is a 18 dimensional square matrix step 2 calculating the modulus matrix a modulus matrix which is denoted by m is calculated as follows 19 m i 21
 l l 1 l lwhere _i l i 1 l is the i th largest eigenvalue of l and i is the identity matrix then the nonzero elements in the i th row of m which is denoted by m_i are transmitted to x_i these nonzero elements corresponds to x _i and its neighboring nodes for example in figure 5 there are three nonzero elements in m _1 i e m _11 m _12 and m _15 which correspond to x _1 x _2 and x _5 respectively since only a few nodes are connected with each participating scattered sensor node the matrix m is sparse and the number of the elements to be transmitted is small step 3 performing the iteration of averaging since the proposed localization algorithm and the average consensus algorithm used here are both iterative algorithms it is important to distinguish them from each other the iteration in the former is called the iteration of localization counted by k while the iteration in the latter is called the iteration of averaging counted by t in the k th iteration of localization two whole processes of iterative averaging i e from the initial state to the convergent state should be conducted to calculate j 1lzj k in equation 16 and i 1lwi k x 0i k in equation 17 in the t th iteration of averaging x _i i 1 l first transmits its own value f_i t i 1 l t 1 an updating version of f_i 0 i 1 l to its neighboring nodes and then updates it by adding up the products of the nonzero elements and the values received from its neighbors for example according to the topology illustrated in figure 6 f _1 t m _11 f _1 t 1 m _12 f _2 t 1 m _15 f _5 t 1 at the t th iteration of averaging this step actually realizes a matrix multiplication as follows 20 f t 1 m f t where f t is a column vector that consists of f_i t i 1 l note that equation 20 coincidentally involves l local convex combinations on the l participating sensor nodes which can be distinguished from the global convex combination in equation 16 by analyzing their different summands the fast convergence of equation 20 which means f_i t i 1 l would converge to i 1lfi 0 l in a few iterations of consensus has been proved in 14 if the variation of the global local estimation i e x _0 k x _0 k x _0 k 1 has not exceeded a predefined range threshold x 0th for three iterations of localization the process of localization will be terminated the sink node should know the indexes and locations of x _i i 1 l for generating the corresponding graph and x _i i 1 l should know l and the nonzero elements in m_i i 1 l for performing the iterations of consensus thus some information exchanges between the sink and the participating scattered sensor nodes are engaged in the first two steps however the first two steps are conducted only once at the first iteration of localization i e k 1 therefore the communication burdens in these two steps are acceptable basically there should be some routine communications between the sink and the scattered nodes to guarantee the conventional operations of the wsn 4 simulation results in this section the localization performance of the proposed dlse method is assessed through simulations first the basic simulation setup which is used to generate figures 2 and 5 and served as the prototype of the following simulations is described then the process of distributed averaging which is the premise of distributed implementation of dlse is demonstrated afterwards the localization performance of dlse is compared with the trust region reflective algorithm which is recommended for solving centralized nonlinear lse problem finally the ability of locating a remote chemical source using dlse is assessed 4.1 basic simulation setup the simulated wsn was composed of 300 nodes that were randomly distributed over an 80 m 80 m square the lower left corner and bottom margin of this square were taken as the origin and abscissa axis of the global cartesian coordinate system respectively in figures 2 and 5 the chemical source was located at 300 4000 cm and the chemical substances released from the source was diffused by the flow with a near surface velocity of v 70 cm s the eddy diffusivity k was set as 10_4 cm_2 s the unit of the release rate in robert s original paper 15 is g s and thus the associated unit of concentration is g cm_3 at 20 c and standard atmospheric pressure the mass concentration in g cm_3 can be transferred to the volume concentration in the most commonly used unit ppm by multiplying an exponential 22.4 m 10_9 where m is the molecular weight of the released substance the release rate q in our simulations was set as 114 g s which can cause the concentration range up to dozens of ppm when m 46 i e the molecular weight of ethanol and the sensor source distance is tens of meters referring to 7 the mean and standard deviation of the measurement errors were 10_ 5 kg m_3 and 8 10_ 6 kg m_3 correspondingly the concentration threshold was set as 10_ 5 kg m_3 to eliminate the measurements with extremely low snrs by setting a presumed chemical source at the center of each of the mesh grids on the node deployment square which is denoted as x0 a group of ci i 1 l can be calculated by substituting x0 for x _0 in equations 6 and 7 then the value of the objective function with respect to different presumed source locations can be calculated by substituting different groups of z_i i 1 l and the corresponding ci i 1 l to equation 13 the logarithmic transform of these values are illustrated in figure 2 according to figure 2 a global minimum appears near the actual source location while there are also several local minima and saddle points at other locations in the square to generate figure 5 the measurements of 30 participating scattered sensor nodes i e z_i i 1 30 were substituted for c in equation 14 4.2 demonstrating the process of distributed averaging as mentioned in section 3 the convex combination of local estimates is calculated by using a distributed average consensus algorithm which serves as the prerequisite of the distributed implementation of our method thus before assessing the localization performance of our method it is necessary to demonstrate the process of distributed averaging at the k th iteration of localization the coordinates of the local estimates x _0 k i 1 l were convexly combined to form the global estimate i e x _0 which were considered as the initial values i e f _i 0 x _0 k i 1 l then these values were updated by using the values from the neighboring nodes at each iteration of averaging the abscissas of the local estimations i e x _0 k i 1 l at different iterations of localization were illustrated in figure 7 as shown in figure 7 the distributed averaging of x _0 k i 1 l was performed eight times which were associated with eight iterations of localization at each time of the averaging the abscissas maintained by different participating scattered sensor nodes converged to the abscissa of the global estimate i e x _0 k k 1 8 in about ten iterations of consensus moreover the abscissas of these global estimates converged near the abscissa of the actual chemical source which was located at 300 4000 cm 4.3 the influence of the initial point the trust region reflective trr algorithm 24 which is recommended in matlab was used to solve the standard centralized nonlinear lse of the source location and as the benchmark to assess the performance of our method the trr algorithm which is based on the interior reflective newton method is a subspace trust region method trust region approaches approximate the function to be minimized with a simpler function which can reasonably reflect the behavior of the original function in a neighborhood around the current point i e the trust region then the trust region sub problem which minimizes the simpler substituted function over the trust region is solved at each iteration of trust region approaches the trust region methods are local search methods since the solution can only move in the trust regions thus trr is a typical local search algorithm although the structure of the nonlinear lse problem is exploited in trr to enhance efficiency the influence of initial point on the localization performance of trr and dlse were assessed in two different cases and the results are illustrated in figure 8 note that in figure 8 the initial points are directly connected to the associated final estimates for trr while the intermittent global estimates in a single localization were connected to each other for dlse as shown in figure 8 trr succeeded several times when the initial point was near the source location otherwise it would be stagnated at some of the local optima or failed in starting the search contrarily dlse succeeded from all of the initial points in the two cases and achieved relatively small localization errors compared to the large size of the node deployment area therefore the locations of initial points hardly influence the localization performance of dlse in other words dlse can overcome the problem of poor convergence caused by the multiple local minima and saddle points of the objective function in equation 13 which would obstruct the convergence of trr and other local search algorithms 4.4 the performance of locating a remote chemical source as shown in figure 8d dlse succeeded in locating a remote chemical source which was located far away from the node deployment area however the results presented in figure 8d was obtained based on limited times of simulation of locating the same source to get a more convictive assessment of the performance of locating a remote chemical source the actual chemical source was located at different locations far away from the node deployment area for each location of the chemical source 100 times of simulations were conducted with the measurements collected by the nodes which were randomly re deployed at the beginning of each simulation trr was not considered in these cases due to its poor convergence
 even when the actual chemical source was located in the node deployment area as shown in figure 8a since the initial point can hardly influence the performance of dlse it was set as the centroid of the node deployment area i e 4000 4000 cm in all of these simulations the statistical results of these simulations were represented with error bars in figure 9 as shown in figure 9 all of the chemical sources were successfully located with relatively small localization errors compared with the large sensor source distances the localization errors became larger with an increase in the distance between the source and the node deployment area because the theoretical concentration is inversely proportional to the sensor source distance when other variables are kept constant according to equation 11 the snr of the measurements decreased which would influence the localization performance as the distance between the source and the node deployment area increased however the performance of any localization method based on concentration measurements might be influenced by the snr of the measurements 5 real experiment results in addition to the simulations our methods were assessed in realistic experiments using a wsn which consists of twenty five real sensor nodes 5.1 the sensor nodes and realistic environment the sensor node was constructed based on the c51rf cc2431 module wireless dragon co ltd chengdu china each of the nodes was equipped with a mics 5521 sgx sensor technology co ltd neuchatel switzerland gas sensor to measure the chemical concentration the nodes can communicate with the sink node via the wireless zigbee protocol the sensor nodes are able to reliably transmit the real time sensing voltages of mics 5521 to the sink node due to the limitation of our currently available nodes the wind speed was measured by two additional windsonic anemometers gill co ltd hampshire england the general picture of the experimental installations is shown in figure 10 a reduced scale wind tunnel which is a cuboid with 300 400 cm_2 area by 90 cm height was built up to create an approximately homogeneous wind field the inlet and outlet of the wind tunnel are two parallel sides of the cuboid an array of electrical fans was integrated in a flat rack which was mounted in the wind inlet clean air was blown into the tunnel through the wind inlet more details about the wind tunnel can be found in 25 a pump and a flow controller were used to blow saturated ethanol vapor from the bubbler into the wind tunnel through a long pvc tube the density of the saturated ethanol vapor in the bubbler was maintained by a thermostatic bath the saturated vapor pressure and density can be calculated using antoine s equation and the clausius clapeyron s equation respectively then the product of the volume flow rate and the density of the saturated ethanol vapor can be considered as the theoretical release rate of the chemical source 5.2 sensor calibration before the sensor readings can be used to represent the concentration the sensors should be calibrated to find an accurate mapping from the sensor readings to the concentration due to the controlled homogenous wind field the concentration distribution and the sensor readings are approximately steady after a period of time 4 since this specific work condition approaches the closed sampling space 26 during the calibration process the sensor nodes were enclosed inside a closed glass box whose cubage is 108 l as shown in figure 11 the box was placed in the wind tunnel to make the sensors work under the same humidity and temperature like those in the process of localization then multiple calibration points can be created by dropping in certain volumes of absolute ethyl ethanol and blowing them to accelerate their evaporation with convective wind the relationship between the sensitivity s i e the ratio of the sensing resistance to the baseline resistance and the concentration c_s in ppm is well fitted to the transform relationship log s a log c_s b in the range c_s 10 1000 ppm 27 thus the unknown parameters i e a and b can be identified by fitting the steady sensing voltages and the associated actual concentrations to the calibration curve note that we refer to the final steady concentration which was calculated by substituting the approximately steady voltage to the identified transform relationship as the measurement in the rest of this section 5.3 identification of the release rate and the eddy diffusivity according to equation 8 when   which means the sensor node lies on the positive abscissa axis of the cartesian coordinate system in figure 1b the concentration of the node is 21 c q2kd 12 1dwhere  q k can be considered as a constant parameter during the process of localization however the premise is that the value of q and k are identified before the localization suppose a standard chemical source which was releasing at a controlled release rate q _0 0.01 g s was placed in the wind tunnel and taken as the origin of a cartesian coordinate system like the one in figure 1b all the sensor nodes were placed along the positive abscissa axis the abscissas of these nodes were set on the premise that the reciprocals of the distances from these nodes to the standard source should range from 0.003 to 0.008 in increments of 0.0005 the relationship of the concentration measurements of these nodes and the reciprocals of the associated distances was fitted into a straight line which was shown in figure 12a then the value of 0 2 0 q0 k can be identified as the gradient of the fitted line and k can be calculated by dividing q _0 by the identified value of  _0 according to figure 12a the function of the fitted line is c 6002.4 d 0.62 and the identified value of k is 103.15 cm_2 s note that in real cases the source to be located and the standard source may release simultaneously so the concentration measurements used to identify k should be the increments of the measurements caused by the standard source with the identified value of k we can further identify q by measuring the concentration along the centerline of the plume the first step is to determine the unknown centerline of the plume caused by the source to be located because the distribution of the concentration measurements collected along the line perpendicular to the wind direction satisfies the normal law of errors 15 the unknown centerline can be determined as the line passing the maximum concentration point along the downwind direction to verify this normal distribution the twenty five sensor nodes were placed along a line vertical to the plume centerline the measurements of these sensor nodes were plotted in figure 12b since the measurements on the centerline of the plume caused by the source to be located satisfy d  2c  q k the value of  2 can be determined as the gradient of the line fitting the relationship between d and 1 c however the distance between the sensor node and the unknown source i e d was unknown the gradient of the fitted line can only be approximately determined as d 1 c when d is relatively small thus fifteen sensor nodes were placed with equal spacing d 20 cm on the centerline of the plume caused by the source to be located the noisy concentration measurements of these sensor nodes i e z_i i 1 15 and the associated value of  1 z 1 z_i 1 z_i _ 1 i 2 15 were shown in table 1 in this experiment the flow rate of the bubbler and the temperature of the bath were kept at 600 sccm ml min and 60 c respectively as mentioned in section 5.1 the calculated theoretical release rate was 0.0078 g s as shown in table 1 the mean of the values of  1 z 1 z_i 1 z_i _ 1 i 2 15 is 0.0037 ppm_ 1 then the value of q can be identified as 0.0071 g s which is close to the calculated theoretical release rate 5.4 experiment results after the above mentioned preliminaries the performance of dlse and trr were assessed with real measurements note that to avoid the complicated programming with the zigbee protocol the concentration measurements were transmitted to the workstation and the distributed implementation of dlse was realized off line however the online distributed implementation of dlse is applicable after a further study on hardware design and embedded programming which was not focused in this paper four scenarios were created by changing the flow rate of the bubbler from 400 sccm to 1000 sccm in increments of 200 sccm while keeping the temperature of the thermostatic bath the wind speed at 60 c 70 cm s respectively the concentration threshold is set as 10 ppm to eliminate the measurements with low snrs based on the measurements collected in each of the groups one hundred of tests with different randomly selected initial points were conducted using trr and dlse the boxplot of the localization errors in these groups were shown in figure 13 as shown in figure 13a although the minimum localization errors obtained using trr were comparatively small their overall distribution was highly fragmented and not symmetrical with respect to the median thus the good performance of trr is not guaranteed if the initial point is not properly chosen in figure 13b dlse succeeded in all of the tests with considerably high accuracy the localization errors obtained based on the same group of measurements were generally symmetrically distributed with respect to the associated medians in addition higher flow rate of the bubbler which means larger release rate of the chemical source and more participating scattered sensor nodes results in smaller mean of localization errors 6 conclusions in this paper a distributed chemical source localization method is proposed for a wsn aiming to minimize the summands in the objective function of lse based csl using wsns i e the sum of squared measurement errors individual local estimations of the source location are conducted on the participating scattered
 sensor nodes this scheme avoids gathering the raw measurements and enables the realization of a distributed estimation method the local estimates are convexly combined into the global estimate which is used as the prior information for the local estimation at the next iteration of localization the global estimate includes the information of all the local estimates in different degrees and enables collaboration among all the participating scattered sensor nodes our method shows a global convergence property with fast convergence rate even when the actual chemical source is far away from the deployment area of the wsn thus the initial point of our method can be preset as a random point before the process of measurement our method iteratively incorporates the global information about the source location in a distributed manner so as to achieve a global convergence property when the distribution models of radioactive substance and acoustic energy are utilized our method can also be adapted to locate the radioactive and acoustic sources future works may cover deriving a theoretical probability of being the real chemical source for the local estimates when such a probability is used as the weight of the associated local estimate our method could evolve into a distributed particle filter this work is supported by the financial support from the national natural science

Q introduction in the late 19th century freud suggested that the cause of sexual perversion involves biological and developmental factors as well as psychoanalytic factors 1 in recent years researchers defined paraphilia as the addictive impulsive and compulsive expression of excessive sexual desire 2 the term sexual deviation was first used in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm i and it was regarded as the subcategory of sociopathic personality disorder the term paraphilia was first used in the dsm iii according to the criterion of dsm iv tr paraphilia is described as recurrent intense sexually arousing fantasies sexual urges or behaviors generally involving 1 nonhuman objects 2 the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one s partner or 3 children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of at least 6 months these symptoms cause serious problems and damage in social occupational or other important functions in the dsm iv tr paraphilia is classified as gender identity disorder and is divided into eight categories exhibitionism fetishism frotteurism pedophilia transvestism voyeurism sexual sadism and sexual masochism the prevalence rate of paraphilia has been indirectly estimated through sexual crime reports in france 14 of the prisoners were reported to be sexual offenders 3 in 1998 in england 11 of the prison population had an experience of sexual offence in the united states 17 of adolescent prisoners were reportedly sexual offenders there are various therapeutic methods for sexual offenders such as psychoanalytic psychotherapy cognitive behavior therapy e g aversion therapy surgical castration and drug treatment for reducing sexual desire however the opinion that punishment on the offenders is needed for public safety could conflict with the opinion that the most clinically effective therapeutic method needs to be selected 4 drugs used for the treatment of paraphilia include ssri selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cyproterone acetate medroxyprogesterone and gnrh gonadoprophin releasing hormone analogues among them gnrh analogues are artificially synthesized agents of natural decapeptide gnrh which is a hormone produced in the cell bodies of hypothalamic neurons and which is secreted directly into the hypophyseal portal system gnrh analogues induce the downregulation of gonadotroph cells the suppression of progesterone secretion and the mild suppression of follicle stimulating hormone 5 gnrh analogues are drugs mostly used as selective medicine for central precocious puberty gnrh analogues stimulate and enhance the gnrh receptors of hypophysis in the initial stage but later gradually suppress the receptors consequently downregulating the gnrh receptors and desensitizing hypophyseal responses to gnrh 5 6 three representative commercial drugs of gnrh analogues are goserelin 3.75 mg and 11.25 mg triptorelin 3.75 mg and 11.25 mg which was recently approved in europe for the treatment of male patients with severe sexual abnormality and leuprorelin among them leuprorelin leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg and 11.25 mg which is one of the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone lhrh analogue depot agents has also been used as a selective treatment for central precocious puberty leuprorelin has clinical effects on obstetric and gynecologic diseases such as endometriosis and urologic diseases like prostate cancer as well as precocious puberty also gnrh analogues have recently been reported to have clinical effects on paraphilia with abnormal sexual behavior 7 8 few studies have investigated the effects of gnrh agents on patients with paraphilia this is because finding subjects with paraphilia is difficult due to reluctance to be identified or their refusal to have hormone therapy on the other hand long acting gnrh depot agents are advantageous for children and adolescents who have poor compliance or special patients who refuse drug administration however the disadvantage of the depot agents is that there are not enough study results regarding safety and effects when compared to oral drugs 9 10 11 12 13 unlike normal developmental persons mentally retarded persons with paraphilia are not able to express symptoms and difficulties by themselves thus medical help is essential and an individualized approach is necessary 11 while studies on the drug treatment of paraphilia have been conducted elsewhere in korea until recently only one case report by our research team with regard to the study for the clinical effect of gnrh depot agents on paraphilia was available 13 we administered leuprorelin a gnrh depot agent to a severely mentally retarded patient with intractable paraphilia for 6 months who had shown little symptom improvement despite continuous drug treatment and later observed significant decreases of sexual desire and behavioral symptoms this case report is the first such report in korea a review of the pertinent literature concerning mental retardation with paraphilia is also presented case description the patient was a 20 yr old male who visited the outpatient clinic of dankook university hospital on 31 october 2012 with chief complaints of continuous masturbation genital exposure and aggressive behavior toward family members that started 2 yr ago the patient was diagnosed with paraphilia category sexual exhibitionism and frotteurism and severe mental retardation by a child psychiatrist based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fourth text revision edition dsm iv tr 2 and was hospitalized for 4 weeks to have psychotherapy and drug treatment clomipramine 50 mg and paroxetine cr 37.5 mg the patient was diagnosed with autistic disorder and severe mental retardation at the age of 5 at a child psychiatric clinic and then attended a special school without undue problems self injurious behaviors or aggressive attitudes were seldom observed since the patient had a rather gentle personality in the patient s elementary school and middle school years self injurious behavior began at that time fluoxetine 10 20 mg was administered for about a month at a neuropsychiatry clinic which produced an improvement from august 2011 the patient spent much time alone at home as the patient s father had to nurse the patient s grandmother for 2 months the patient was locked up in home during the daytime the patient s aunt who lived nearby visited and prepared a daily meal for the patient the patient seldom masturbated before however as the patient spent more time alone he gradually became obsessed with masturbation and masturbated dozens of times a day sexual exposure with no sexual shame also increased gradually at the same time the patient showed increased aggression such as suddenly hitting family members with hands or throwing objects based on the father s observation pubic hair and muscles were noticeably developed in the patient s body shape in february 2012 the patient displayed an aggressive attitude toward the aunt and father who were living together in addition to masturbation symptoms the father took the patient to a hospital and the patient started to take valproate and olanzapine 5 mg the symptoms were improved after about 3 months of treatment the patient attended another hospital due to a matter of residence where considering side effects olanzapine was changed to aripiprazole symptoms were significantly exacerbated the patient again attended the outpatient clinic of the original hospital and the aripiprazole was discontinued and olanzapine 7.5 mg begun there was a weight gain of more than 10 kg and the patient s weight exceeded 100 kg the patient was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for 4 weeks with the chief complaints of continuous masturbation from morning until night sexual exposure excessive sexual desire and aggressive behavior toward his father symptoms did not improve and the frequency of masturbation increased therefore with a guardian s request the patient visited the outpatient clinic of our hospital to have hormone therapy intended to reduce sexual desire the patient again visited the outpatient clinic of our hospital despite continuous drug treatment and psychotherapy paraphilic symptoms were not improved if the patient s symptoms continue there seemed to be a high possibility of being imprisoned as an offender therefore the therapist considered hormone injection therapy which is a more active therapeutic method the therapist explained the studies on the injection of gnrh depot agents to the patient and guardian and obtained prior consent also the use of gnrh depot agents for paraphilia was approved by the patient s father a basic physical examination for the patient was performed including medical history evaluation blood test and electrocardiogram to compare the effects before and after the treatment the clinical global impression severity cgi s 14 clinical global impression improvement cgi i and aberrant behavior checklist abc 15 were performed the abc is a symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors in individuals aged 6 to 54 with mental retardation there are 58 items and five subscales in addition survey evaluation was conducted for the patient s parent regarding the pregnancy and early childhood of the patient developmental history and anamnesis general psychological evaluation including an intelligence test was also conducted by a clinical psychologist during hospitalization the therapist administered leuprorelin depot 3.6 mg once after discharge from the hospital the same agent was administered once a month by subcutaneous injection for the drug treatment paroxetine 60 mg valproate 1 000 mg and olanzapine 5 mg were administered during this period when the patient revisited after discharge from the hospital the frequency of masturbation and sexual exposure was markedly decreased and the aggressive attitude was also noticeably decreased
 abc cgi s cgi i were measured during hospitalization 4 weeks after the drug administration and 24 weeks after the drug administration respectively the masturbation frequencies and time decreased from 15 20 4 5 hr to 0 0 hr the cgi s score changed from 6 points to 2 points and 1 points with time and the cgi i score showed 2 points after 4 weeks and 1 points after 24 weeks the abc scores did not show significant improvements the testosterone level was 6.62 ng ml during hospitalization decreased to 0.87 ng ml at 4 weeks and decreased further to 0.59 at 6 months table 1 a weight gain occurred as the side effect of leuprorelin depot 3.6 mg administration the patient s appearance became seemingly more gentle and there was no other side effect complaint as for the risk of osteoporosis and no problems were found when examined by an orthopedist discussion this is the first reported clinical use of leuprolide for mr with paraphilia in korea the best treatment for paraphilia is to ememploy psychotherapy and drug treatment together 16 however depending on the severity of disease there may be cases in which an active therapeutic method should be applied from the initial stage the world federation of societies of biological psychiatry has suggested various therapeutic approaches depending on the severity of paraphilia 16 in this case study offences were continuously observed since the patient s paraphilic behavior was very severe and there was a possibility of being imprisoned as an offender also as education or persuasion was hard due to severe mental retardation the guardian requested an active and fast treatment therefore the therapist directly applied the guideline of level 5 which administers gnrh agonists without going through levels 3 and 4 which administer cyproterone acetate or medroxyprogesterone following the levels that employ psychotherapy and antidepressant drug administration a previous case study 10 11 reported that when triptorelin was administered to 6 patients with paraphilia for 7 yr every abnormal sexual behavior disappeared in 5 patients recently rosler and witztum 12 administered the gnrh agonist triptorelin 3.75 mg to 30 patients with paraphilia for 8 42 months along with supportive therapy the average age of the subjects was 32 25 subjects displayed pedophilia and 5 subjects were other unclassified patients with paraphilia a notable improvement was observed in the abnormal sexual fantasy and desire scale score of the patients where it decreased from an average of 48 points before the treatment to 5 points after the treatment in our case study 3 months after the administration of leuprorelin which is a gnrh agonist an improvement of 4 points was observed in the cgi scale and an improvement of 12 points was observed in the sast scale this result is consistent with the aforementioned studies 10 11 12 gnrh depot agents are thought to suppress abnormal sexual behavior by directly acting on the central nervous system in an animal experiment of male rats the direct administration of gnrh into the cerebral spinal fluid was found to decrease aggression 17 gnrh depot agents are more effective in reducing testosterone within tissues than cpa or mpa agents 18 the continuous administration of gnrh depot agents can bring about a number of side effects by continuously reducing the secretion of androgen gnrh agents can cause hypogonadism especially symptoms such as impotence in aged males and could also decrease testicular volume and body hair 12 in addition the administration of gnrh agents could reduce normal sexual desire as well as the desire of abnormal sexual behavior the long term administration of gnrh agents can lead to decreased bone density 12 long term administration of gnrh analogues can induce a number of side effects such as hepatotoxicity hypertension weight gain and calcium loss on the other hand depressive disorder has been reported as a side effect of gnrh agonists nevertheless gnrh analogues are recommended as one of the most effective therapeutic methods of paraphilia 16 most side effects from hypogonadism are reversibly recovered when drug administration is stopped in this case study 10 kg 6 months weight gain and appetite increasing were observed due to the side effect of the drug but there was no other particular side effect complaint in the first 2 4 days after the administration of gnrh depot agents special attention is required because sexual drive could increase 19 this is because gnrh analogues temporarily increase progesterone and follicle stimulating hormone in the initial stage therefore during this period some clinicians recommend the administration of cyproterone acetate 12 which is a steroidal antiandrogen agent and flutamide which is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen agent in this case study the flare up phenomenon reported in the previous studies which occurs after the administration of gnrh depot agents was observed for 2 7 days however it was alleviated without the additional administration of particular drugs it was reported that ssri reduces abnormal sexual behavior without decreasing normal sexual desire in this case study paroxetine 60 mg had been continuously administered but a significant improvement in paraphilic symptoms was not observed when it was administered alone in the drug treatment however it seems to have been helpful for the improvement of the secondary depression and anxiety symptoms of the patient according to the guidelines of the united states hormone injection therapy e g cyproterone acetate medroxyprogesterone and gnrh analogues is not a preferred treatment of paraphilia 16 mostly for ethical reasons from an ethical view hormone therapy should be applied only when patients meet all the conditions appropriate for the treatment and the committee for medicinal products for human use describes the conditions as follows 20 first the patients have been diagnosed with paraphilia after careful psychiatric evaluation by a psychiatrist second for hormone therapy the clinical symptoms and behavior of the patients should be consistent with the clinical diagnosis and the therapy should be appropriate for the patients health status third the therapy should not cause serious risk to the patients health or should not do harm to others fourth the hormone therapy could be implemented only when other less invasive therapeutic method does not exist fifth the patients have to agree to the hormone therapy in this case study the improvement of paraphilic symptoms was observed after the administration of the gnrh analogue however the results cannot be generalized since this is only one case report and above all the result was obtained in a short period of time therefore it will be necessary to investigate the result of the clinical effect and side effect observed after a long period of treatment also the therapeutic effect of gnrh analogues needs to be reexamined in a long term study for a large scale paraphilic patient group that is elaborately designed and accurately diagnosed and evaluated especially the safety of gnrh analogue administration needs to be sufficiently investigated besides the clinical effect if the clinical effect of gnrh analogues is sufficiently proved in the future studies despite a number of limitations on the clinical effect and safety the gnrh analogues are expected to be used as an alternative or supplementary therapeutic method in addition to the diverse therapeutic methods currently used for the treatment of sexual offenders the

Q introduction global procurement mechanisms are a major potent force in successful global health programming such mechanisms purchase key technologies such as vaccines antiretroviral drugs and contraceptives for distribution across many countries however many more critical technologies particularly those affecting maternal and newborn health require advancement of local markets for ultimate sustainability and public health impact unfortunately many of these markets suffer from a basic dysfunction the lack of sufficient market incentive to stimulate production and distribution as well as complicated local supply chains and delivery systems to reach those most in need a multifaceted approach is needed to address the basic causes of dysfunction in the market for public health commodities in this article we present 6 case studies of technologies recently introduced into developing country markets oxytocin in uniject care hpv helping babies breathe woman s condom safe water and ultra rice we use a market introduction framework as an organizing structure to highlight key elements that may have contributed to varying degrees of success and when lacking to certain challenges in these markets through these examples we hope to contribute to the global discussion on best practices for creating healthy markets as the global health community works together to accelerate access to lifesaving technologies market types global institutional and consumer to cultivate the market for a given commodity it is important to first understand key characteristics of that market although the boundaries between different market classifications are somewhat permeable there are generally 3 types of markets for global health technologies globally coordinated markets where technologies such as vaccines are procured and financed through centralized channels typically in these types of markets a small number of buyers such as the gavi alliance formerly the global alliance for vaccines and immunization the united nations children s fund unicef and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria purchase large volumes of product through pooled procurement at low prices which are then distributed through relatively well organized channels local institutional markets in which national institutions such as a ministry of health purchase technologies such as drugs used for obstetric care whether through their own resources or from donor grants or loans these markets require strong facility inputs such as skilled health workers complex clinical protocols to ensure proper use of commodities robust logistics systems to ensure commodities and equipment remain continuously available at health facilities and local health budgets consumer markets in which a large number of disaggregated consumers buy health goods such as oral rehydration salts or water filters for their own use although the value proposition may be clearer and the products easier to use than those in institutional markets these products require purchase by consumers who often do not consider health related purchases a high priority these markets also require significant investments in distribution and marketing by private sector companies that naturally prefer to serve consumers with higher incomes due to the potential for greater profit margins and more consistent demand the crucial role of the latter two or local markets is amply demonstrated by the work of the un commission on life saving commodities for women and children uncolsc which is leading global efforts to improve access to 13 potentially lifesaving commodities essential to maternal and neonatal health table the commission has developed key recommendations to address the most critical bottlenecks facing product introduction from innovation and global market shaping to local delivery and demand generation table market classification for uncolsc technologies technology globally coordinated markets local institutional markets consumer markets maternal health oxytocin misoprostol magnesium sulfate newborn health antenatal corticosteroids injectable antibiotics neonatal resuscitation chlorhexidine family planning female condoms implants emergency contraception child health oral rehydration salts amoxicillin zinc abbreviation uncolsc un commission on life saving commodities for women and children compared with global procurement both institutional and consumer markets have less defined advocacy and policy pathways and often suffer from lack of donor funding to continue purchasing the product beyond initial introduction pilots as they do not have large scale committed funding mechanisms behind them manufacturers are often left with insufficient demand to continue supply while buyers have limited experience with and understanding of the value of the technology and hence have weak motivation to purchase in institutional and consumer markets manufacturers are often left with insufficient demand to continue supply while buyers have limited experience with and understanding of the value of the technology beyond the lack of financing there are several additional reasons that these markets have not been effectively established the framework we offer attempts to capture the broad range of elements required for effective introduction of global health products into local institutional and consumer markets market introduction framework a broad search of the published literature revealed that few market introduction frameworks for global health technologies exist most players involved in shaping global health markets rely on informal unpublished frameworks that generally describe the market problems such as high price identify specific causes such as risk for manufacturers and then focus on interventions to address the root cause such as enhancing demand through advanced purchase _1 these approaches tend to focus on the traditional market levers of price volume information and quality they are useful analytical frameworks that can help us identify which market interventions might address the problem most effectively however by defining the market introduction sphere more broadly we are better able to consider the larger range of causes for success or failure in these markets and consequently a broader range of potential interventions this thinking has been captured in some excellent frameworks addressing the diffusion of health innovations for example atun et al point out the need to clearly delineate the problem the willingness of major stakeholders to support adoption and the readiness of health systems infrastructure _2 free also considers a wide range of factors such as appropriate design of the technology and engagement of gatekeepers _3 by defining the market introduction sphere more broadly we are better able to consider the larger range of causes for success or failure in these markets our market introduction framework builds on this critical systems wide thinking it is a modified version of a framework initially developed by hozumi et al through interviews with stakeholders with scale up experience and through retrospective evaluations of global health interventions advanced by path _4 this empirically driven framework serves as more of a how to guide than an analytical framework it focuses on critical market design factors related to the introduction of global health products assuming that external elements such as a strong leader and relevance of the product to the global health context are already in place often even relevant products with strong champions still fail to reach market developing deploying and scaling up global health technologies is a multistep iterative process taking many years starting with research design and development validation through regulatory approval introduction and scale up this framework elaborates only on the introduction phase of this typical value chain for technologies introduction particularly for institutional and consumer markets has several elements that must come together to ensure both the availability of the commodity and its effective use in fact the introduction phase is often where global health technologies destined for local markets falter this phase can be broken down into its essential components of both supply and demand as illustrated by the 4 pathways in the figure 1 supply chain 2 finance 3 clinical use and 4 consumer use the supply chain and finance pathways are relevant to both institutional and consumer markets while clinical use pertains only to institutional markets and consumer use only to consumer markets these critical pathways tend to run in parallel figure framework for introducing global health technologies into local markets the introduction phase is often where global health technologies destined for local markets falter 1 supply chain pathway within the introduction phase the supply chain pathway in both institutional and consumer markets focuses on conventional supply chain development for technologies that are capital intensive or where quality manufacturing cannot be established locally a centralized global manufacturer may be the most effective commercialization strategy however as quality improves technologies have increasingly been licensed to regional or local manufacturers and appropriate manufacturing equipment needs to be purchased a formal transfer of the technology is then conducted and manufacturing is validated also distribution channels to appropriate clinical facilities retail stores and other outlets need to be established 2 finance pathway the finance pathway focuses on enhancing demand through appropriate financing for the buyers of these technologies for institutional markets advocacy is often required to ensure appropriate institutional financing mechanisms whether through government or private facilities to support ongoing clinical use of the
 technology this requires cultivating multiple champions in the ministries of health and finance to advocate the necessary budget allocations tiered pricing strategies vouchers and full subsidies may need to be considered by institutional buyers who pass a portion of their costs to distributors health facilities or consumers consumer products may also require financing sometimes in the form of low cost loans particularly for more costly durable goods such as water filtration systems low income consumers often cannot pay the full cost upfront these financing mechanisms can be provided through microfinance institutions and other businesses focused on consumer finance sometimes incentives such as longer payback periods are needed for consumers to take advantage of these financing mechanisms 3 clinical use pathway a third and very important introduction pathway particularly for institutional markets is creating demand among providers and institutions by developing the clinical capacity to use the technology within health facilities this is a rigorous undertaking in itself it entails generating operational evidence on use of the technology in clinic settings developing formal clinical policy to guide how the technology would be used appropriately within a clinical protocol training to ensure that health workers understand the revised clinical guidelines and establishing enforcement mechanisms such as supervisory systems to ensure sustained use lack of movement down this pathway has significantly slowed the adoption of many new global health technologies a very important introduction pathway is creating demand by developing capacity to use the technology in health facilities 4 consumer use pathway the demand side for consumer markets usually requires social marketing to influence consumer purchase of products sold through retail channels which may or may not be partially subsidized traditional behavior change techniques also are used to encourage uptake of consumer products distributed through public and private sector channels for instance village leaders may discuss healthy behaviors with mothers groups in doing so they may encourage the use of health products for their family such as oral rehydration salts to treat diarrhea or soap to prevent infection these introduction activities if carefully orchestrated and pursued in parallel provide the basis for successful market introduction of global health products as noted in the figure introduction success is achieved through early signs of market penetration sustainability through public private and nongovernmental partners and ultimately health impact in target markets more significant penetration of these outcomes would indicate achievement of scale we use this introduction framework in a retrospective analysis of 6 technologies 3 from institutional markets and 3 from consumer markets each with varying degrees of success and failure this framework can also serve as a guide for new market introduction efforts case studies from institutional markets oxytocin in uniject injection system supply chain and financing hinder market introduction oxytocin in uniject is an example of an introduction pathway complicated by high costs leading to difficulty in establishing the supply chain with manufacturers and distribution partners and consequently a financing pathway as well thus the market for oxytocin in uniject has not yet been established there is a strong public health case for this technology hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in low income countries responsible for an estimated one third of such deaths annually _5 and postpartum hemorrhage accounts for the majority of obstetric hemorrhage cases _6 for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage oxytocin 10 iu is the drug of choice recommended by the world health organization who oxytocin is temperature sensitive and needs to be injected intramuscularly its use has generally been restricted to medically trained staff in health facilities oxytocin in uniject was developed to simplify oxytocin administration through a single use prefilled device that delivers the correct dose in deliveries attended by auxiliary health workers oxytocin in uniject provides a feasible alternative for delivery of prophylactic oxytocin oxytocin in uniject delivers oxytocin to prevent postpartum hemorrhage through a single use prefilled device there is good quality clinical and operational evidence to support clinical policy permitting use of oxytocin in uniject by auxiliary health workers and outside facilities including effectiveness and feasibility studies _7 _ _9 the product attributes have been tested to ensure that they meet the need at both the community and higher levels of health service a recent trial in ghana demonstrated the feasibility at the community level of home delivery for prevention and early treatment _10 _ _11 thus the clinical use pathway has largely been followed even though in some countries medical associations have objected to policies that would allow for task shifting of oxytocin administration to community health care workers however the greatest challenge for oxytocin in uniject has been in reaching sustainable levels of supply and demand side financing to catalyze the market cost has been the root problem current pricing is more than us $1 per unit which far exceeds the approximately $0.25 cost of a needle syringe and ampoule of oxytocin to date buyers are unwilling to pay the premium for oxytocin in a prefilled uniject device furthermore it is not a needed product at higher levels of the health system as facilities are well stocked with needles syringes and ampoules of oxytocin a study in argentina however has demonstrated higher compliance with oxytocin in uniject than with conventional administration _12 one of the reasons for the higher cost of oxytocin in uniject is that it requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to invest significant upfront capital to procure and commission specialized filling and packaging equipment donor funding to defray these costs has not been available to the various manufacturers of oxytocin additionally as with any drug in a new form of primary packaging the pharmaceutical producer would need to apply for and obtain drug regulatory approval in each country where the product would be sold a long and expensive process that creates further disincentive to supply this is especially true for those drug and vaccine manufacturers that are in highly competitive generic markets such as oxytocin as the investment may not shift in market share of their product for those manufacturers in highly competitive markets an investment in a new delivery mechanism may not shift market share of their product we have collaborated with a number of pharmaceutical producers over the past decade to try to establish a sustainable supply of oxytocin in uniject three producers went as far as producing pilot batches and undertaking the costly stability studies due to the lack of clear demand at a price that would be commercially attractive 2 producers dropped the project before completing development and regulatory approval one producer stated it had cost close to us $100 000 to conduct the stability studies to who s prequalification standards if that producer could theoretically earn a $0.20 per dose profit above the manufacturing cost the company would have to sell 500 000 doses just to recoup the cost of the stability study which is only one component of the total investment needed to produce and sell oxytocin in uniject the one producer that took oxytocin in uniject to market in a number of latin american countries has not achieved sustainable sales in private sector channels and also as discussed the institutional markets have not developed it is not clear whether that producer will keep oxytocin in uniject in its product line lack of movement down the finance pathway also due to price has further contributed to the difficulty of establishing a sustainable market for the product various groups have modeled the cost effectiveness of oxytocin in uniject and have found that its value proposition remains very sensitive to the final price of the product the current high price has made it difficult to advocate the product s cost effectiveness leading to the lack of financial commitment from institutional buyers lessons learned regardless of the potential public health benefit and apparent elegance of the approach an innovation must be extremely affordable relative to the alternatives for institutional uptake to occur simply put we now understand the difficulty of putting an inexpensive product such as oxytocin into a relatively expensive injection device such as uniject additionally we have learned that in the absence of a concerted demand side intervention market mechanisms are unlikely to produce sufficient demand to yield significant economies of scale we had expected the unit price to drop over time as manufacturers achieved economies of scale through high volume production we also expected sales in private markets at higher prices to cross subsidize lower priced sales in public sector markets neither scenario has materialized we have also learned to moderate our expectations of how much drug and vaccine manufacturers in highly competitive generic product markets will invest in regulatory and market introduction of new delivery mechanisms for their products even with support from the global health community and especially if demand is unclear finally we learned that if pricing does not fall within the target range for institutional buyers as development manufacturing and introduction progress the public health community must consider withdrawing further support sooner in order to redirect energy and resources toward more marketable endeavors that may consequently have more impact without market penetration
 it follows that sustainability and health impact have yet to be realized from this product care hpv lack of operational evidence on clinical use slows pace of adoption despite a clear supply pathway and good evidence of its effectiveness use of care hpv remains limited the care hpv test is an example of how lack of movement down the clinical use pathway starting with the need for operational evidence of use within facilities has slowed the pace of adoption the care hpv test is a screening test that detects the presence of human papillomavirus hpv the primary cause of cervical cancer through cervical or vaginal samples it was specifically designed for use in developing countries through collaboration between its manufacturer and path clinical studies involving more than 20 000 women in 3 countries have established that care hpv is almost twice as accurate as existing screening methods such as the pap smear and visual inspection by acid via when used as a primary screening method _13 _ _14 although the cost per test for care hpv is higher than for other screening methods its lower rate of false negatives make it a strong public health tool considering the high morbidity and mortality if cervical cancer goes undetected the lower rate of false positives also avoids unnecessary costs associated with follow up finally since care hpv can be used with vaginal samples it can help avoid a pelvic exam assuming clinical guidelines are in place for self sampling however no country has yet adopted such a practice stakeholder interviews revealed that in general clinicians in developing countries are not clear about which screening to treatment strategies to use for patients with hpv since use of hpv tests as the primary screening method is new to both developed and developing countries who guidelines were finally released in 2013 stating that practitioners can go directly from screening with care hpv to treatment in low resource settings without the need for cytology followed by a diagnostic test such as colposcopy _15 it will take time and effort for these guidelines to be mainstreamed into clinical practice in addition policy makers in developing countries are uncertain about how to design the implementation program most appropriate for their local situation as well as about the implications of that approach for their human and financial resources for instance since care hpv requires processing at a lab it is unclear how many lab facilities should be enabled within a given district s unique size and capacities in order to maximize both cost efficiencies and appropriate coverage lessons learned one key lesson learned from the care hpv experience is the clear need for operational studies to answer many of these questions so that appropriate clinical guidelines can be established this evidence is especially important in the absence of model clinical policies from the developed world that can be followed in addition these studies may need to be pursued in several countries to test feasibility in different clinical environments simultaneously financial mechanisms for purchase by ministries of health need to be identified and developed to create a viable and sustainable market however since the financial mechanisms may not be established before the evidence is generated and clinical use policies are modified additional funding from the global health donor community will be required there is simply insufficient market incentive for the private sector to invest in the operational studies and advocacy required for enabling this market without these elements in place the pace of adoption for care hpv will continue to be slow again due to the lack of market penetration at this point neither sustainability nor health impact has yet been achieved operational evidence is especially important in the absence of clinical use policies from the developed world that can be followed helping babies breathe well coordinated supply chain financing and clinical capacity pathways provide a model for success the helping babies breathe hbb initiative exemplifies the successful introduction of medical equipment into local institutional markets through well coordinated supply chain financing and clinical use pathways hbb s success is attributable to the u s agency for international development s usaid strong global development alliances gdas model as well as to the commitment of laerdal the key equipment supplier and a founding member of hbb to saving the lives of newborns in low resource countries as such hbb took the role of a backbone organization to orchestrate the various actors and activities along the various introduction pathways as a gda funded by usaid hbb now includes 20 partners from the private and public sectors in 2010 hbb began offering evidence based training and high quality affordable neonatal resuscitation equipment to birth attendants in developing countries as of november 2013 60 countries had implemented the hbb curriculum of which 18 have national plans coordinated by governments in the 60 countries approximately 130 000 health care providers were trained in addition hbb supplied 120 000 bag and mask resuscitation devices 150 000 suction bulbs and 50 000 simulators on a not for profit basis and donated another 4 500 hbb training kits laerdal supplies high quality resuscitation equipment at reasonable cost to hbb partners that support the program laerdal has also donated simulators and other equipment to enhance use and spark further demand additionally hbb s master training programs a critical element of the clinical use pathway provides health care personnel with important operational experience with resuscitation equipment in selected developing countries laerdal also offers grants to support implementation of the training program as well as guidelines on purchasing and maintaining equipment the training not only increases competencies of birth attendants but also meets their latent need for higher quality resuscitation equipment this is important groundwork for creating sustainable institutional demand from within public sector facilities lessons learned clearly hbb is a model to follow hbb has stimulated the supply side of the market through affordable equipment and the demand side through training and implementation grants in turn this has created a viable market maintaining engagement of the many partners and stakeholders involved while hbb still needs to shift from being mostly donor driven to country driven the initiative s effective coordination role and the demand it has helped to establish by normalizing use of these products in clinic settings bodes well for adoption and scale up of this program by public health institutions in developing countries it is likely that the role of the market coordinator is an underused mechanism in the uptake of global health products this example demonstrates clear market penetration with sustainability now emerging as hbb training guidelines are adopted by various ministries of health and incorporated into global health projects related to newborn resuscitation significant health impact is likely to follow case studies from consumer markets woman s condom lack of coordination between supply and demand limit market penetration the woman s condom exemplifies the challenge of trying to establish a sustainable supply and distribution chain for a new product when it is not coordinated with an equally well resourced demand generation effort the woman s condom is a new female condom whose design and early stage validation was funded initially by usaid to expand contraceptive options for women in developing countries path and its research partners employed a user centered design process to develop a product that has proved to be highly acceptable _16 _ _19 user acceptability has been a key barrier to use of other female condom products the woman s condom employs a user centered design process to improve acceptability female condoms are primarily a consumer product in which the decision to purchase and use the product lies with the end user however during the first 20 years of introduction female condom purchasers largely have been bilateral and multilateral institutions such as usaid the united nations population fund unfpa and ministries of health that distribute condoms through government sponsored programs at free or highly subsidized rates although this is a legitimate strategy for introducing a new product class in the absence of robust funding to support demand generation it has not allowed female condoms to become established as a consumer class product manufacturers have focused more attention on sales to institutional buyers and while new female condom products such as the woman s condom are helping to enlarge and differentiate the class consumers are still conditioned to receiving the product for free the absence of sustained demand generation is not the only issue female condoms are more costly than male condoms which further reduces demand from both institutional and consumer buyers for instance in 2009 donors purchased 71 male condoms for every 1 female condom _20 to address these issues path and its manufacturing partner dahua medical apparatus company of shanghai china have established a partnership to build a sustainable supply chain for the woman s condom which leverages both public sector and commercial retail channels the market penetration strategy is to first generate revenue from private sector sales to help cover dahua s costs thus allowing the company to offer more affordable pricing to low resources settings served by the public sector in the longer term the woman s condom has received south africa bureau of standards certification marking 2013 shanghai food and drug administration approval 2011 and ce conformit europene or european conformity marking 2010 which allow
 for distribution and marketing in private sector retail channels in south africa china and europe respectively early introduction efforts in china and south africa are underway but have already faced challenges one significant challenge is finding in country distribution partners willing to invest in the extensive marketing and sales required to generate demand for an unfamiliar product the cross subsidy model requires sufficient sales in the commercial sector to cover the costs not recouped through lower prices offered to the public sector however due to the investment involved the revenue from commercial sales is difficult to generate in china for example public sector sales have exceeded commercial sales forcing dahua to sell the product below costs at this time this situation further reduces dahua s ability and incentive to invest in the marketing necessary to cultivate private sector markets lessons learned a key lesson is the need to pursue aggressive demand generation efforts simultaneously while establishing supply and distribution chains in order to create strong incentives for actors along the supply chain to engage several demand side elements have been built into the project including market research with women in china and south africa market tests to target consumer markets and advocacy with the governments in both countries to create a supportive policy environment for female condoms more generally however the investment and scale of the demand generation effort has likely been underappreciated in fact no real social marketing campaign has yet been launched in either country due to the inherent risks involved for manufacturers and distributors a more significant investment by the donor community may be warranted in order to catalyze this market similar to other examples without market penetration sustainability and health impact have yet to be achieved with this product a significant investment in demand generation is needed for new classes of consumer products safe water coordinated supply financing and consumer demand demonstrate viability of market our safe water project has experimented with several pilot strategies for developing the retail market to sell household water filters to consumers at the base of the economic pyramid the most successful strategies have involved tight coordination between supply availability of financing and consumer demand generation efforts for enhancing the perceived value of the product a pilot study in madhya pradesh india offered consumers free water filters manufactured by path s commercial partner hindustan unilever limited hul in an effort to draw them into the market although 44 of these consumers later took a loan for 2 replacement cartridges from our microfinance partner spandana sphoorty financial limited 35 of consumers reported gifting or selling the water filter for those who used the product current and consistent use dropped to 19.1 after 6 months and then eventually to zero at 10 months _21 since the water filter was a giveaway neither the salespeople nor con sumers appreciated its value therefore salespeople did not have an incentive to make a strong sales pitch in contrast in tamil nadu erode india the same water filter was offered to consumers without a subsidy after 10 months 21 of consumers reported currently using the filters _20 suggesting that the strategy succeeded in attracting consumers who valued the product and decided to try it based on their perception of its merits a woman in india uses a household water filter the strongest results were observed in cambodia where a water filter super tunsai manufactured by hydrologic social enterprise was paired with a loan scheme offered by the microfinance institution visionfund the original tunsai water filter was not perceived as desirable because of its very basic design and large subsidies to support its use we worked with hydrologic to redesign the original tunsai filter to make it more appealing to customers both from an aesthetic and functional point of view the redesigned super tunsai filter was then marketed as a desirable product targeting consumers aspirations toward attaining middle class status in spite of the fact that the super tunsai cost twice as much as the original tunsai filter customers were willing to take full loans from visionfund to purchase the product after 10 months 39 of consumers reported currently using the filter _21 after marketing the redesigned super tunsai water filter toward consumers aspirations to attain middle class status use improved among consumers lessons learned pricing at full retail value is preferable to subsidies as it attracts more committed consumers and avoids undermining the value of the product as demonstrated in the tamil nadu pilot we have observed an even stronger effect in cambodia when this strategy was complemented with social marketing around desirability and affordable replacement cartridge costs in fact hydrologic s replacement cartridges are approximately us $5 $10 per year compared with $25 for the hul filter used in india hydrologic and visionfund are now scaling up their winning strategy to 11 provinces in cambodia additionally path is using the best practices from its water filter pilots to launch new programs including a plan to make latrines available in cambodia through similar schemes as well as cook stoves solar lamps and insecticide treated bed nets in other markets the cambodia pilot in particular has demonstrated reasonable market penetration while signs of sustainability and health impact are emerging ultra rice fortification technology sustainability plans for both supply and demand drive scale up efforts to introduce ultra rice in brazil show how creating pillars of sustainability on both the supply and demand sides of the market can enable replication and scale up by local organizations while path s ultra rice technology has a 15 year history of fits and starts the approach in brazil has created the knowledge and understanding of how to achieve sustainability before the end of each country specific funding stream under the umbrella project the ultra rice technology is a formulation and method for creating reconstituted rice grains packed with micronutrients such as iron thiamin zinc and folic acid when blended with conventional rice typically at a 1 100 ratio the resulting fortified rice can provide up to 50 of the recommended daily intake of a range of micronutrients this helps bridge dietary gaps in micronutrient intake especially among populations for whom rice constitutes a large portion of their caloric intake school boys in cambodia enjoy rice fortified with the ultra rice technology to bridge dietary gaps in micronutrients in brazil the market introduction process for fortified rice started by transferring the technology to local companies including urbano agroindustrial one of the nation s largest rice millers and adorella aliementos a medium sized pasta manufacturer these companies continue to produce fortified rice kernels which will not only be incorporated into their own fortified rice products but as an obligation under path s license also be sold to other millers in order to create a competitive market additionally we have directly licensed the ultra rice technology to a preeminent agribusiness university the federal university of viosa giving that institution both the right and the obligation to license the technology to additional manufacturers in the future as the market grows establishing a small subset of current suppliers as well as an engine for further growth bodes well for supply side sustainability on the demand side instead of marketing the product primarily to lower income market segments which suffer disproportionately from the consequences of micronutrient malnutrition we are targeting the widest possible range of consumers in order to establish consumer confidence the social marketing campaign is built around a quality seal on the packaged rice conveying aspiration for the product the federal university of viosa and the national rice millers association abiarroz verify the quality of the fortified grains and homogeneity of their blend into traditional rice this process is open to all rice brands including those typically purchased by consumers with lower incomes while millers of both higher and medium price rice brands have led the way lower priced brands are likely to move through the verification process in due course thus leveling the playing field with respect to fortified rice quality this marketing strategy avoids any stigma that might develop if only the lower cost brands were fortified and has already reached hundreds of thousands of consumers in the first 6 months since the launch of fortified rice in commercial retail markets additionally to further enhance demand we have produced marketing materials for our partners and have negotiated rights to use cartoon characters owned by turma da monica a local disney equivalent which are well recognized by brazilians prior to the end of the project we plan to have these rights transferred to abiarroz so that the cartoon characters continue to be used as ambassadors to the product in order to stimulate demand also we have enlisted a number of well known and highly respected supporters ranging from noted journalists to well recognized health experts who have now established micronutrient malnutrition as one of their social causes lessons learned although not all elements of this market penetration strategy can be replicated across rice markets in africa and asia we have learned the value of closely coordinating the various introduction pathways as well as building sustainability into the product introduction plans from the outset donor supported projects that are designed to stimulate global health markets are most successful when engines
 of further growth for both supply and demand are established well before project funding expires in other words planning for sustainability should commence at the start of the project not after the pilot project has launched and tested the product in brazil planning for sustainability required identifying the array of local organizations that can take ownership of the product and laying out the market development process well before path and partners exit this example demonstrates early signs of significant market penetration and sustainability although health impact in the target market may be achieved at a slower pace as fortified rice gains further traction in the brazilian market planning for sustainability should begin at the start of the project summary while the global health community has decades of experience bringing technologies such as vaccines bed nets antiretroviral therapies and malaria drugs to scale through global procurement mechanisms we are only now reflecting more systematically on our experience in developing local institutional and consumer markets especially in light of uncolsc s focus on these types of commodities global procurement markets require complex coordination among who the gavi alliance unicef and other multilateral institutions to organize purchase and distribution at scale however the global health community wrestles even more with local market introduction the lack of incentives on both demand and supply sides of the market creates natural dysfunction but our accumulated experience can serve as guideposts as we navigate these challenges among the salient lessons learned from these 6 case studies is the need to design more effective projects box sometimes our failure to scale is a failure of design we either do not recognize all the critical supply and demand elements that need to be pursued or assume other players in the market ecosystem will take them on one critical design consideration is the need to build supply and demand simultaneously not only to avoid a fatal imbalance but also to ensure that all relevant demand side pathways are included in the technology introduction plan as captured in our framework box lessons learned from introducing global technologies into local markets build supply and demand simultaneously consider the need for one organization to lead oversee and coordinate the entire market introduction activity from the start have a strong vision and intention to reach full scale through bold holistic project concepts pay strong attention to the incentives and profitability of the private sector involved local market introduction of global health products can also benefit from a lead organization too often in the public health arena each player whether a nongovernmental organization ngo government or private sector firm supports only a few elements of the required market development activity such as generating evidence of operational feasibility or pursuing advocacy for policy change these small steps are vital elements on the critical path toward scale generally however no one organization takes on the important role of driving the market introduction process forward often a necessity in these largely dysfunctional markets the lack of such a lead is a natural consequence of the piecemeal nature of donor funding and the niche competencies that ngos have developed to win grants few general contractors exist in global health markets consequently we often have ample evidence of potential impact several interested manufacturers and strong data to support advocacy but despite all this many of these markets have failed to flourish a lead organization provides the natural base from which to plan and execute activities along all 4 of the introduction pathways captured in our framework market orchestration also requires a strong vision and intention to reach scale a goal that needs to be built into the project design from its inception and that is embodied within the set of supply and demand side pathways captured in the framework projects driving toward sustainability within their life span create stronger and faster impact the project nature of donor funding is a cumbersome mechanism for developing local markets we need to develop stronger models that more closely mirror the required process for reaching scale such as longer grant periods flexibility to adjust funding levels to changing market needs and more holistic project designs finally but most importantly we need to pay stronger attention to the incentives for profitability of the private sector which will continue to play an increasingly important role in public health this is a key element of the supply side pathway described in the framework for new technologies the private sector is often faced with a cost structure that requires pricing above status quo alternatives and uncertain demand due to such issues as the lack of clear distribution channels clinical policies and value proposition for the buyer this most often leads to significant risk and consequently an underinvestment in market development by the private sector while the global health community has developed some effective risk reduction strategies for products entering global procurement markets such as advanced market commitments for vaccine development expedited regulatory pathways for orphan drugs and graduated copays for vaccine purchases by ministries of health we need to develop similar enabling innovations for those products entering local markets we also need to better analyze the upfront risks to assess whether there would be natural incentives to both supply and adoption of the technology once the risks are sufficiently reduced through an infusion of grant funding effective market introduction is paramount and the only way to achieve sustainability conclusion our experience underscores the widespread understanding that there is no universally applicable market introduction strategy for products of global health importance the framework introduced in this article is a starting point reflecting the general elements of market introduction that may be emphasized differently for each unique product market and cultural context we hope that others continue to build upon the framework with additional insights gained from their experiences such empirically driven frameworks may help minimize our missteps in design which can be costly and time consuming and can stymie our collective effort to create health impact in the most vulnerable groups as a global health community we need to continue sharing our rich experiences in developing markets for global health products to ensure that global initiatives such as uncolsc with so many important products destined for local institutional and consumer markets maximize their potential to save lives the authors would like to thank patricia coffey

Q 1 introduction wireless sensor networks wsns are experiencing significant momentum in academic industrial and standardization circles wsns comprise sensor and actuator nodes that enable intelligent monitoring and control applications in a wide spectrum of environments including smart cities home automation remote health and precision agriculture to mention but a few 1 a plethora of communication protocols for wsns have emerged 2 among these the contribution of the ietf is of outstanding importance since this organization is producing ip based protocol specifications that allow the connection of wsns to the internet and thus enable the internet of things iot 3 because many wsns are multihop and thus require a routing protocol the ietf routing over low power and lossy networks roll working group 4 recently developed the ipv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks rpl 5 rpl was specifically designed to meet the requirements of wsns 6 9 and is a central component of the ietf protocol suite for the iot therefore since rpl is expected to be widely deployed it is fundamental to characterize its properties and evaluate the influence of its main parameters and options on network performance despite its novelty rpl has already been a subject of study 10 21 most of the literature focuses mainly on evaluating rpl behavior in steady state 16 21 however performance of rpl during network convergence may be critical since it may significantly affect user experience e g when a user expects fast network creation to fulfill a certain action and it is fundamental to global network recovery due to topology changes nevertheless rpl network convergence has received limited attention the studies that consider rpl performance in transient state do not provide a deep analysis since they do not focus on the joint influence of rpl parameters and mechanisms and network characteristics such as network size and density on network convergence performance 10 17 21 in this paper we investigate by simulation the influence of the main rpl parameters on the network convergence process and we also propose and evaluate a mechanism that leverages an option available in rpl for spurring the network convergence process the performance parameters we consider are network convergence time network join time and message overhead in order to assist the derivation of conclusions we also evaluate the number of collisions during network convergence with the aim of obtaining comprehensive results we carry out extensive simulations for a wide range of conditions in terms of network size and density we consider multihop networks whereby the nodes use ieee 802.15.4 i e the most prevalent radio interface for wsns in order to achieve realistic results we have tuned the simulation environment in order to accurately model the link behavior observed in real experiments however the results presented should be confirmed on a real testbed in a future work results show that rpl network convergence performance depends dramatically on the use and adequate configuration of key parameters and mechanisms the findings and contributions of this work provide a guideline for configuring and selecting adequately crucial rpl parameters and mechanisms for achieving high network convergence performance on the basis of network characteristics such as size and density as well as a characterization of the related performance trade offs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews the main characteristics of ieee 802.15.4 section 3 gives an overview of rpl with special focus on the procedures for network creation section 4 describes the simulation environment and methodology used in the paper section 5 studies the impact of the main rpl parameters on performance of the network convergence process section 6 evaluates a mechanism proposed by the authors for accelerating network convergence leveraging an option available in rpl section 7 reviews related work and finally section 8 presents the main conclusions of the paper 2 ieee 802.15.4 main characteristics this section gives a short summary of the main ieee 802.15.4 characteristics ieee 802.15.4 is the de facto family of standard radio interfaces for low cost low power and low rate wireless communications ieee 802.15.4 specifies physical phy and medium access control mac layer functionality 22 the widely implemented ieee 802.15.4 2003 specification defines three physical layers in the 868 mhz the 915 mhz and the 2.4 ghz bands which offer raw data rates of 20 kbit s 40 kbit s and 250 kbit s respectively the latter physical layer which uses an industrial scientific and medical ism band available worldwide is the most commonly used one at the mac layer ieee 802.15.4 networks may be configured in two modes i on the basis of a superframe structure delimited by beacons or ii in a beaconless mode which is generally preferred due to its simplicity whereby nodes use unslotted csma ca for medium access in this mechanism the process for transmitting a data frame requires the sender to wait for an initial random backoff time subsequently the sender performs clear channel assessment cca to check the state of the medium if the medium is idle the sender carries out the transmission otherwise the sender performs a new backoff of a duration randomly chosen from a greater window of possible values and evaluates the medium state again this procedure is repeated several times if the medium is always found to be busy if the number of unsuccessful channel access attempts reaches a maximum limit the frame transmission fails and the frame is discarded ieee 802.15.4 offers optional reliability for unicast frames by allowing the request of acknowledgment frames broadcast frames are not acknowledged network layer multicast packets see subsection 3.1 are encapsulated in broadcast frames in ieee 802.15.4 3 rpl overview in this section we provide a rpl overview with emphasis on the procedures for network creation the section is organized in three parts first we present the mechanisms used by rpl to build a network we then briefly review the routing mechanisms in rpl finally we present the trickle algorithm which is used by rpl to disseminate control messages for network creation and maintenance 3.1 dodag construction rpl builds and maintains network structures called destination oriented directed acyclic graphs dodags a dodag is defined as a graph composed of nodes and links that constitute paths that point towards and terminate at a special node called the root the dodag root represents a node that generally performs the tasks of a sink or a gateway rpl has been designed and optimized for the transmission of data from sensor nodes towards the root node in theory cycles do not exist in a dodag which inherently provides protection against the problem of loops however researchers have shown that there may exist transitory loops in rpl dodags 23 24 for the construction and maintenance of a dodag rpl nodes locally multicast dodag information object dio messages pseudo periodically by using the trickle algorithm 25 see section 3.3 a dio message contains information that allows a node to discover an existing dodag learn node and network configuration parameters and maintain the network topology in order to join a dodag a node must receive at least one dio message from a neighbor to this end the node may either wait to receive dio messages from its neighbors or may multicast a dodag information solicitation dis message to request the immediate transmission of dio messages from neighboring nodes when a dodag node receives a dis message it schedules itself to send out quickly a dio message once a node has sent a dis message it may send further dis messages until the node receives a dio message in response if no dio message is received after a given period of time the node may decide to become the root of a new dodag each node in a dodag has a rank which abstracts the topological distance between a node and the dodag root each dodag node indicates its rank in the dio messages it transmits a node calculates its rank by applying the objective function of in use in the dodag and using the rank of its neighbors as an input the of defines how nodes use one or more metrics and constraints in order to determine their own rank any rpl implementation must support of zero of0 a metric agnostic of that allows interoperability between implementations in a wide spectrum of use cases 26 based on the dio messages received each dodag node chooses the members of its dodag parent set which is a subset of the dodag node neighbors that provide a path towards the root all members of the parent set of a node must have a lower rank than the node for example in figure 1 the parent sets of nodes e and f are b c d and c d respectively 3.2 routing in rpl rpl provides basically two types of routes which depend on the endpoints involved in the communication upward and downward routes the former offer a path to the dodag root from any other node a downward route provides a path in the opposite direction as described in the previous subsection after joining a dodag each node chooses its parent set every node selects its preferred parent among the members of its parent set by applying the of in use in the dodag the preferred parent of a node offers the default upward route for this node rpl supports downward routes by using destination advertisement object dao messages dao messages are generated and sent upwards by non root nodes to announce themselves as possible destination nodes in order to enable point to point p2p flows i e the transmission of data between any two network nodes rpl offers using upward and downward routes as the default mechanism since this mechanism may not be optimal an improved mechanism for p2p traffic called p2p rpl has been developed 27 p2p rpl allows
 a node to discover a p2p route on demand by creating a temporary dodag rooted at the node 3.3 trickle algorithm as mentioned in section 3.1 rpl uses the trickle algorithm to schedule and transmit dio messages in a network 25 therefore trickle plays a key role in the convergence of a rpl network trickle is a density aware local multicast communication mechanism that is based on a consistency model according to this model a network is in a consistent state when it does not suffer changes and therefore dio messages are consistent with prior dio messages transmitted in this case nodes slow their dio message rate exponentially however when a node detects an inconsistency it increases its dio message transmission rate to resolve the inconsistency quickly on the other hand trickle supports a message suppression mechanism that aims at minimizing the dio message redundancy in a network a detailed presentation of the trickle algorithm is provided next trickle divides time into non identical intervals in each interval every node attempts to send one dio message trickle rules determine whether the transmission will be allowed or not the trickle algorithm operates based on a set of parameters variables and rules which are reviewed next there are three parameters that configure the trickle algorithm the minimum interval size i_min the maximum interval size i_max the redundancy constant k in addition the trickle algorithm uses three variables that track the current status of the algorithm these variables are the current interval size i the tentative transmission time within the current interval t and the number of messages heard within the current interval c the operation of trickle is based on the following steps initially trickle sets i to a value in the range i_min i_max at the beginning of each interval trickle resets c to 0 and sets t to a random point within the range i 2 i whenever trickle hears a transmission that is consistent it increments its own counter c at time t trickle performs the transmission if and only if its counter c is smaller than the redundancy constant k otherwise the transmission is suppressed whenever the interval i expires trickle doubles the interval length if the new interval length is greater than i_max the new interval length is set to i_max then the algorithm goes back to execute step 2 if trickle hears a transmission that is inconsistent it must reset i set this variable to i_min start a new interval and execute step 2 the three main parameters of the trickle algorithm i_min i_max and k are set by the dodag root the values for these parameters are encapsulated in the dio messages sent by the root hence these parameter values are learnt by the root neighbors upon dio reception and are included in the dio messages sent by these neighbors the same process happens for the rest of nodes that join the dodag and thus the parameter values originally announced by the root are propagated to the whole dodag in order to keep a low network convergence time i_min is commonly used as the value for the first interval 28 4 simulation environment and methodology this section presents the simulation environment and methodology used to evaluate the network convergence process of rpl in ieee 802.15.4 multihop networks in order to carry out our simulations we used omnet 29 a well known c based discrete event simulator jointly with mixim an omnet framework created for various types of wireless networks 30 we implemented rpl for this simulation environment as a side contribution we have made the simulation code publicly available 31 the simulated network nodes were static and located following a uniformly random spatial distribution in two dimensional square areas we configured the nodes to use the 2.4 ghz band ieee 802.15.4 physical layer and the beaconless mode functionality we set the mac queue length of the nodes to 1 in order to replicate the value of this parameter in cc2420 a widely used ieee 802.15.4 radio chip 32 we used the log normal shadowing propagation model available in mixim in order to achieve accurate and realistic link behavior in our simulation framework we carried out experiments and tuned the parameter settings of the simulated propagation model based on the experimental results the experiments comprised communication in a link between two telosb nodes 33 running tinyos 34 table 1 shows the main physical and link layer parameter settings used in the simulations in order to evaluate the influence of the network size in our study we considered 3 different scenarios denoted small medium and large network scenarios the area of the large network scenario is 100 100 m_2 which is 5 times greater than the medium network area there is the same relationship between the medium and small network scenario areas figure 2 depicts the nodes location and existing links in example instances of small medium and large network scenarios for a node degree of 10 we also considered the network density in our study by evaluating node degree values of 5 10 and 15 note that this range of network densities covers from relatively sparse networks to highly connected and dense networks as a result we simulated a variety of network sizes and densities ranging from 8 node to 483 node networks which cover a wide range of use cases the number of nodes and the average rank for each network size and density scenario are shown in table 2 for each individual combination of network size scenario network density and protocol configuration we simulated 1500 different randomly generated topologies and evaluated 20 instances of the network convergence process for each topology yielding a total of 30 000 network convergence instances we discarded the results of dodags not formed in less than 10 000 s we applied this measure since we observed that in certain scenarios the time until all nodes receive at least one dio message may be significantly longer than 10 000 s whereas network convergence requirements for most deployments are 3 5 orders of magnitude below that threshold 6 8 in order to characterize this phenomenon we evaluated the percentage of networks formed in less than 10 000 s in the scenarios considered in subsection 5.1 small medium and large network scenarios for different node density and k values when i_min is set to the default value i e 8 ms see figure 3 in the described conditions the minimum and maximum percentage of times that networks formed in less than 10 000 s are 50.14 and 99.97 which correspond to the large network scenario when the node degree is 5 and k is 1 and the small network scenario when the node degree and k are 15 respectively as shown in figure 3 the percentage of networks not formed in less than 10 000 s grows as the network density decreases since nodes have a lower amount of neighbors from which dio messages can be received as the redundancy constant decreases because a greater number of dio message transmissions are suppressed and as the network size increases since the average number of end to end hops between the root and the rest of nodes increases as well 5 evaluation influence of the main rpl parameters on network convergence performance in this section we study the influence of the two most crucial rpl parameters on the performance of the network convergence process in the network scenarios presented in the previous section the two considered rpl parameters are the redundancy constant k and the minimum interval i_min this section comprises two subsections which focus respectively on the impact of each one of the aforementioned rpl parameters on network convergence performance 5.1 influence of the redundancy constant on the network convergence process one of the rpl parameters that affects network convergence performance to a greatest extent is the redundancy constant k as presented in subsection 3.3 this parameter limits the number of transmitted messages per trickle interval in a given coverage area in order to analyze the influence of the redundancy constant on the network convergence process we simulated the network size and density scenarios shown in table 2 for a range of redundancy constant values between 1 and 15 which includes the default value for this parameter stated by the rpl specification i e k 10 5 for the results presented in this subsection the rest of rpl parameters were set to the default values stated in the rpl specification note that i_min was therefore set to 8 ms we evaluated network convergence time dodag join time of a node number of dio messages transmitted and number of collisions figure 4 shows average network convergence time in small medium and large network scenarios for different node density and k values to obtain the convergence time of a network we calculated the time from the instant in which the dodag root starts its first trickle interval until the instant in which all nodes have joined the dodag we consider that a non root node joins a dodag when it receives a dio message for the first time as it can be seen in figure 4 using low values for the redundancy constant yields high network convergence time in all network size and density scenarios considered this behavior is mainly due to the message suppression mechanism in the trickle algorithm when the root node transmits its first dio message the neighbors of the root that receive this dio message schedule themselves to send their own first dio message however when k is set to a low value only a few neighbors of the root will be allowed to transmit their dio message in the current interval if the rest of root neighbors if any hear a number of dio messages greater than or equal to k in the current interval they will suppress their dio message transmission as a result nodes that are only neighbors of the latter root neighbors have to wait for subsequent intervals to have the opportunity to receive their first
 dio message the same phenomenon happens as dio messages propagate through the network which finally leads to high network convergence time as the redundancy constant increases up to medium values the network convergence time decreases this occurs because with greater redundancy constant values the probability that nodes suppress their dio messages is lower therefore the probability that a node receives its first dio message earlier is greater however network convergence times do not vary significantly as the value of k increases beyond the values around the node degree the reason for this behavior is that for such values of k the number of dio message suppressions is low since many nodes have a number of neighbors lower than k and thus varying k within the mentioned range does not significantly affect the network convergence time as is also shown in figure 4 network convergence time decreases with the node degree since greater network density provides better network connectivity and a greater amount of opportunities for a node to receive dio messages from its neighbors by analyzing figure 4 results in deeper detail we found that the relative impact of the redundancy constant on network convergence time does not vary significantly with the network size when networks are sparse however as the network density increases the improvement that can be achieved by increasing the redundancy constant grows with the network size for example when the node degree is 15 in the small network size scenario a network convergence time decrease factor of 8.3 can be achieved by using k 15 in comparison with the result obtained for k 1 however for the same node density the network convergence time decrease factor that can be achieved by comparing the use of k 15 with k 1 in the large network scenario is 14.5 figures 5 6 7 show the cumulative distribution function cdf of the network convergence time for all the network size and density scenarios considered the results illustrated by these figures evidence the dramatic impact of the redundancy constant on network convergence time increasing the redundancy constant value causes the percentage of dodags formed in a given time to increase as well for example in the medium network scenario when the node degree is 5 figure 6a and k is equal to 1 more than 80 of the dodags are formed in less than 120 s while the same ratio of dodags are formed in less than 18 s for k 2 as the network density grows network convergence times decrease as well still in the medium network scenario when the node degree is 10 figure 6b and k is set to 1 80 of the dodags are formed in less than 2 s whereas the same ratio of dodags are formed in less than 0.6 s for k 2 in the same scenario for a node degree of 15 figure 6c 90 of the dodags are formed for any value of k in less than 0.6 s on the other hand the reader may observe the wave shape that can be appreciated in figures 5 6 and 7 especially when the node degree is low this behavior is due to the interval duplication of the trickle algorithm and reflects the distribution of the number of intervals needed to completely form a dodag as well as the size of the interval in which a dodag is formed another useful performance result is the time it takes for a node to join a dodag figure 8 shows the cdf of the dodag join time for a node in the considered network scenarios when the average node degree is 5 and k is equal to 1 around 80 of the nodes have joined the dodag in 0.1 s 1.1 s and 15 s in the small medium and large network size scenarios respectively these times are significantly smaller than the average network convergence times shown in figure 4 therefore a relatively small fraction of the nodes require a large amount of time to join a dodag whether this is a critical aspect for the user depends on the application requirements the network is deployed for as shown in figures 5 6 7 8 the difference between the curves for k 1 and for k 2 is greater than the difference between the curve for k 2 and any curve for k 2 this result illustrates that the network convergence time and join time improvement that can be achieved by increasing the redundancy constant decreases as the redundancy constant grows in order to provide insight on the influence of the redundancy constant on network convergence performance we also evaluated the average number of dio message transmissions and collisions that occur from the first dio transmission by the root until the instant in which all nodes join the dodag for all the network size and density scenarios considered the corresponding results are shown in figure 9 the average number of dio message transmissions increases as the redundancy constant grows up to the node degree in fact increasing the redundancy constant within this range of values leads to a lower number of dio message suppressions when the redundancy constant is greater than the node degree varying this rpl parameter does not have a significant effect on the number of dio messages transmitted since the number of message suppressions is very low the number of collisions varies with k similarly to the number of dio messages transmitted since the number of dio message collisions grows with the number of dio messages that are actually transmitted note that despite the number of dio message collisions increase with the redundancy constant the network convergence time decreases with the redundancy constant this happens because as the redundancy constant grows even though a subset of the additional dio messages transmitted are lost due to collisions a greater number of dio messages are received correctly by non dodag nodes finally we found that the relative influence of k on the number of dio messages transmitted and to a lower extent on the number of collisions increases with both network size and network density as network size grows the influence of k increases due to the multiplicative effect of a greater hop count between the root and any other node from the results shown in figures 4 5 6 7 8 9 it can be concluded that there is a tradeoff between network convergence time and node join time and the number of dio messages sent which depends on the redundancy constant in order to achieve a low network convergence time the redundancy constant should be set to a value equal or close to the average node degree greater redundancy constant values might cause an unnecessary increase in the number of dio messages transmitted and collisions in very dense areas of a network which however would not yield a network convergence time decrease the influence of the redundancy constant grows with both the network density and size 5.2 influence of the minimum interval on the network convergence process in this subsection we study the effect of the minimum interval i_min on the network convergence process we evaluate the impact of i_min on the network convergence time number of dio message transmissions and number of collisions during the network convergence process we also analyze the relationship among these performance parameters the rpl specification states that the default value for i_min is 8 ms 5 however in order to investigate the influence of i_min on network convergence performance we evaluate different i_min values in the same scenarios and for the same redundancy constant values considered in the previous subsection figure 10 shows the average network convergence time when i_min is set to 4 ms 8 ms and 16 ms in the scenarios and for the settings presented in section 4 as it can be seen in figure 10 decreasing the minimum interval yields a reduction of network convergence time regardless of the network size the network density or the redundancy constant for the range of i_min values considered the reason is that when i_min decreases the length of trickle intervals decreases as well therefore nodes send their dio messages earlier and more frequently and as result a dodag forms faster another important consideration that can be inferred from figure 10 is that halving the i_min value decreases the network convergence time by a factor smaller than two as we already mentioned when i_min decreases the number of dio message transmissions during network convergence increases as a consequence the number of collisions increases as well see figures 11 12 and 13 the number of collisions increase does not avoid the network convergence time decrease by decreasing i_min but it is the reason why this decrease is smaller than the i_min decrease analyzing in deeper detail the number of dio messages transmitted during network convergence figures 11a 12a and 13a we observe that as both the redundancy constant and the network density grow the influence of i_min becomes greater this is due to a lower amount of dio message suppressions in the network as a consequence of a greater number of dio message transmissions the number of collisions also grows as i_min decreases see figures 11b 12b and 13b the relative influence of i_min on the number of collisions does not vary with the redundancy constant except for a high network density whereby as the redundancy constant grows the influence of i_min becomes smaller this happens because for a large i_min value e g i_min 16 ms the number of collisions is low for low redundancy constant values however as the redundancy constant grows and when the network is dense the probability of collision significantly increases due to the greater number of dio message transmissions in the network on the contrary for low i_min values e g i_min 4 ms the number of collisions is already high for low redundancy constant values since such i_min values approach the dio transmission time in the 2.4 ghz ieee 802.15.4 physical layer i e 2.82 ms and thus the number of collisions increase with the redundancy constant is smaller than that observed for greater i_min values from the study carried
 out in this subsection it can be derived that there exists a tradeoff between network convergence time and dio message overhead and collisions that depends on i_min varying i_min in the range of values considered in this study has a greater quantitative effect on the number of dio messages sent than on the network convergence time fine tuning i_min has a greater impact on the number of dio messages transmitted during network convergence as both the redundancy constant and network density grow whereas the relative impact of i_min on network convergence time does not vary significantly with the redundancy constant network size or network density 6 dis trickle a mechanism for accelerating network convergence this section proposes and evaluates a mechanism for leveraging dis messages in order to accelerate rpl network convergence in some scenarios a node may have to wait for a long time to receive a dio message and thus to join a dodag as we described in section 3.1 a node may discover nearby dodag nodes in a short time by sending dis messages which will trigger a quick response in the form of a dio message from neighbors that have already joined a dodag however the rpl specification does not state any rule or scheduling algorithm for the transmission of dis messages 5 in this section we propose and evaluate dis trickle a mechanism for accelerating the network convergence process by using dis messages we first present dis trickle and then evaluate its influence on network convergence performance 6.1 dis trickle design dis trickle comprises two components an initial delay and a scheduling algorithm this subsection describes in detail both components for nodes that may send dis messages it is beneficial to introduce an initial delay before the first dis message transmission this is motivated by the fact that dio messages need time to propagate through the network and thus nodes at a multihop distance from the root node must have the opportunity of receiving dio messages before sending premature and unnecessary dis messages the value of the initial delay has to be set carefully on the basis of the network size and density such an initial delay is also used in the cooja contikirpl implementation whereby it is set by default to 5 s 28 however 5 s may be too large a value for the characteristics of many networks including the ones considered in this paper based on simulation results that are discussed later in section 6.2 we set the initial delay to 200 ms which yields good performance in different network size and density scenarios in terms of network convergence time number of dis and dio messages transmitted and collisions after the initial delay in network zones where nodes have not yet received any dio message these nodes may attempt to transmit dis messages at the same time which may yield an initial dis storm and a high number of collisions on the other hand it is not necessary that all non dodag neighbors of a dodag node send a dis message to trigger a dio message transmission from the latter since all these neighbors have the opportunity of receiving a dio message sent by the dodag node in order to solve the initial dis storm problem as well as to limit unnecessary dis message transmissions we propose applying the trickle algorithm to schedule the transmission of dis messages since the main purpose of using dis messages is the decrease of nodes dodag join time we disable the trickle interval size doubling mechanism in dis trickle on the other hand in order to decrease the number of dis message transmissions and the probability of message collisions while sending dis messages we set the redundancy constant of dis trickle k_dis to 1 another important parameter of dis trickle is the interval size denoted i_dis which defines the time between consecutive dis message transmissions the value of this parameter should be specified on the basis of the dis response time defined as the time between the transmission of a dis message and the corresponding dio reply from a dodag member on the other hand the time between consecutive dis messages should not be unnecessarily large in order to assist the determination of i_dis we next calculate the minimum and maximum dis response time assuming that nodes use a 2.4 ghz band ieee 802.15.4 interface in the beaconles mode see figure 14 let node a which is interested in joining a dodag start the procedure for transmitting a dis message at time t_1 let node b be already a dodag member the physical transmission of the dis message starts after the backoff period and the cca we should note that by default the minimum and maximum backoff times in ieee 802.15.4 are 0 ms and 16.96 ms respectively on the other hand the time needed for performing the cca on telos b nodes running tinyos is 3 ms the physical layer of node a starts to send the dis message at time t_2 and it takes 1.34 ms denoted by t_tx_dis in figure 14 to transmit this message on the other hand node b which has started to receive this dis message at time t_2 finishes receiving the dis message at time t_3 it immediately resets its trickle timer to i_min which is set to 8 ms by default and schedules itself to transmit a dio message in the second half of the trickle interval of size i_min a dio message transmission can take place at any point of the second half of the current interval i e it can suffer a random delay between 4 ms and 8 ms the latter is illustrated in figure 14 finally the physical transmission of this dio message which takes 2.82 ms starts after the backoff period and the cca at time t_5 and node a finishes receiving the dio message at time t_6 considering the duration of all the periods included between t_1 and t_6 the dis response time is a value between 14.16 and 52.08 ms from the basis of this analysis we tested different values for i_dis see the results obtained and discussed later in section 6.2 and based on these tests we finally set i_dis to 30 ms since it yields good performance in terms of both network convergence time and number of dio and dis messages transmitted during network convergence table 3 shows the default values of the dis trickle parameters used in our simulations 6.2 dis trickle evaluation in this subsection we evaluate dis trickle and discuss the results obtained we assume the default value of i_min 8 ms analyze the influence of the redundancy constant on network convergence when dis trickle is used and consider the same range of network density and size scenarios evaluated in section 5 we analyze the network convergence time total number of rpl i e dio and dis messages transmitted and collisions during network convergence we also study the impact of dis trickle parameters on performance as can be seen in figure 15 using dis trickle decreases network convergence time by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude regardless of the network density and size actively requesting dio messages constitutes a dramatically better strategy for non dodag nodes than passively waiting for dio message reception in terms of joining quickly a dodag interestingly the network convergence time improvement yielded by dis trickle does not always lead to performance degradation in terms of the total number of rpl i e dio and dis messages sent in dense networks the rpl message overhead during network convergence does not grow and even decreases when dis trickle is used see figure 16 however in sparse networks e g when the average node degree is 5 dis trickle requires a greater amount of total rpl message transmissions than that needed in absence of dis trickle impact of this phenomenon increases with network size for a deeper analysis of the number of rpl messages sent during network convergence we next study the number of dio and dis messages sent separately figure 17 shows that the average number of dio messages transmitted decreases when dis trickle is used this reduction is more significant as network density decreases the reason is that as shown in subsection 5.1 in a sparse network when dis trickle is not used the network convergence time is very high and during this time a high number of dio messages are transmitted until a dodag is formed however using dis trickle allows non dodag nodes to join a dodag in a shorter time and thus fewer dio messages are required to complete the dodag construction on the other hand when dis trickle is used the number of dis message transmissions decreases as the redundancy constant grows see figure 18 this happens because as k increases a greater number of dodag nodes are able to send their dio messages therefore non dodag nodes have more chances to receive dio messages making it unnecessary to send dis messages another important result is that the number of dis message transmissions increases as network density decreases since a lower amount of dio messages are transmitted naturally by dodag members however a large network size exacerbates the number of dis message transmissions in sparse networks due to the multiplicative effect of a greater number of end to end hops from the root to the most distant nodes therefore in sparse networks the high number of dis message transmissions dominates the total number of rpl messages transmitted during network convergence shown in figure 16 figure 19 illustrates the influence of network density network size and the redundancy constant setting on the relative performance of dis trickle i e compared with not using dis messages in terms of both network convergence time and number of rpl message transmissions in sparse networks e g when the average node degree is 5 using dis trickle improves network convergence time but degrades the total number of rpl messages transmitted since a high number of dis message transmissions are required as aforementioned as the network density increases the network convergence time improvement due to using dis trickle becomes
 lower and does not vary significantly with the network size this occurs because the probability that a node receives dio messages without the need to send dis messages increases with the network density however in dense networks the total number of rpl message transmissions does not grow or even slightly decreases when dis trickle is used the reason for this result is that in dense networks a low number of dis messages are required and the dis messages transmitted help reduce to a similar or even greater extent the number of dio messages sent therefore in dense networks dis trickle improves both network convergence time and number of rpl message transmissions or at least does not degrade this last performance parameter note that the result obtained in small networks for a node degree of 10 and k 1 is an exception to this conclusion whereby the number of rpl message transmissions is slightly degraded when dis trickle is used lastly it can also be observed in figure 19 that the influence of dis trickle decreases as the redundancy constant grows since a greater amount of dio messages are naturally transmitted and a lower amount of dis message transmissions are required with regard to the number of collisions for both dio and dis messages it does not vary significantly by using dis trickle see figure 20 this occurs because dis messages are likely to be sent from nodes that have a low number of neighbors and in addition dis trickle randomizes dis message transmission time and suppresses redundant dis message transmissions therefore when dis trickle is used the number of message collisions does not significantly increase compared with the one observed in absence of dis messages finally in order to understand the influence of i_dis and the dis initial delay on performance of dis trickle we carried out simulations with different configurations of these dis trickle parameters the considered configurations of the aforementioned parameters are shown in table 4 the evaluation is done in the medium network size scenario for a node degree of 5 note that this density corresponds to a sparse network and as shown in figure 4 the average network convergence time is high in the absence of the dis based mechanism therefore we can observe the maximum influence of dis trickle on network convergence performance within the range of considered network densities the results obtained for these different configurations are plotted in figure 21 which shows average results for the following performance parameters network convergence time number of dio and dis messages transmitted and number of collisions considering both dio and dis messages during network convergence note that configuration 1 dashed line curve results in figure 21 is the default set of dis trickle parameter values used in our previous simulations as shown in figures 21a and 21b when the initial delay is set to 100 ms configuration 2 the network convergence time and the total number of rpl messages transmitted are greater than those obtained for an initial delay of 200 ms the main reason is that 100 ms is lower than the time needed by dio messages to propagate through the network thus nodes that are not close to the root may start to prematurely and unnecessarily transmit dis messages while their neighbors are receiving or sending dio messages increasing the number of collisions during the network convergence process figure 21e on the other hand when the initial delay is set to 300 ms configuration 3 network convergence time increases compared with using configuration 2 due to the slower rate of dis message generation figure 21d while the rest of performance parameters do not vary significantly as previously mentioned a suitable value for the initial delay has to be set taking into account network characteristics such as density and size from the results obtained an initial delay of 200 ms offers good performance in the scenario considered since it offers reasonably low network convergence time low number of dio and dis message transmissions and low number of collisions regarding the length of the dis trickle interval i_dis we have tested values within the range of the dis response time values presented in subsection 6.1 figure 21 illustrates that although a small value for i_dis such as 15 ms configuration 4 reduces slightly the network convergence time compared with the default i_dis value of 30 ms configuration 1 it causes the rest of performance parameters analyzed to significantly degrade when i_dis is set to a low value such as 15 ms many premature dis message transmissions take place leading also to a high number of collisions on the other hand using a greater value for i_dis such as 45 ms configuration 5 has the opposite effect on performance results show that there is a tradeoff between the network convergence time and the rest of performance parameters that depends on i_dis a medium i_dis value within the dis response time range yields a good performance tradeoff 7 related work despite the novelty of rpl it has already been a subject of study in the literature 10 21 however only a few research works focus on or consider rpl network convergence this section reviews related work highlighting the differences of such work with the contributions and findings from this paper authors of 12 present a simulation study of rpl based on the cooja contikirpl simulator the main goal of this work is to investigate the impact of network parameters including number of nodes number of dodag roots and packet loss on the performance of the network convergence process the authors evaluate a range of network size values two different network topologies are considered regular topologies whereby nodes are quasi uniformly distributed and random topologies a single value is tested for i_min which was set to 1 s on the other hand the redundancy constant value is not specified in the paper periodical transmission of dis messages is evaluated in this work based on a mechanism used in the cooja contikirpl 28 simulator an initial delay is applied before the first dis message transmission the values used for the initial delay and for the length of the periodic intervals are 5 s and 60 s respectively a survey about the most relevant rpl research efforts along with an experimental performance evaluation of rpl is presented in 13 the performance evaluation of rpl provided by the authors includes network convergence time as a performance parameter based on a single network size of 30 telosb motes running contikirpl 28 i_min is set to a single value equal to 4.096 s which is the default value used in contikirpl however authors neither indicate which is the value of the redundancy constant nor whether dis messages are used or not another performance analysis of rpl that is also based on the cooja contikirpl simulator is presented in 21 the authors evaluate control message overhead network throughput and end to end packet delay in rpl for fixed values of i_min and k set to 4.1 s and 10 respectively this work considers a single area size and two different numbers of nodes 20 and 100 nodes however the authors do not study the network convergence time dis messages are used in this work but the parameter settings and further details on dis message scheduling are not given a simulation based performance evaluation of rpl for a single medium size network is carried out by tripathi et al in 16 results include that global repair i e a mechanism that allows the root node to form a new dodag when bad performance is detected has a significant effect on the control message overhead however network convergence time is not studied in this work i_min is set to a single value equal to 1 s but the redundancy constant value used is not indicated dis based mechanisms are not used in this work clausen et al investigate the efficiency of broadcast mechanisms in wsns using rpl in 10 17 the authors use two mechanisms for dio transmission i the trickle algorithm in which i_min is set to a single value equal to 2 s and ii periodic dio transmission in both schemes the redundancy constant is set to infinity i e the suppression mechanism is disabled the authors evaluate the network convergence time and message overhead parameters based on a fixed node density 50 nodes km_2 for different network sizes in 10 results show that convergence time grows logarithmically with the number of nodes in the network dis based mechanisms are not considered in the paper an experimental evaluation of rpl in tinyos devices is provided in 11 regarding rpl parameters a single value of i_min is considered i_min 128 ms whereas the paper does not mention the redundancy constant setting in order to study the impact of the i_min value on the network convergence time the authors present experimental in a single size and single density network of 40 nodes with perfect and also with lossy channels for three different values of i_min 0.25 s 1 s and 4 s results show that network convergence time increases with i_min which is consistent with results obtained in this paper however the influence of i_min on other performance parameters such as rpl message overhead or collisions has not been considered in the work dis messages have been included in the work however details about dis message scheduling rules or related parameters are not provided by the authors analytical models have also been developed to estimate the network convergence time in a trickle based network authors in 14 provide such a model for line and grid network scenarios based on a method to derive the probability density function of the time until network consistency through the use of laplace transforms however the complexity of the analysis increases very quickly with the network diameter furthermore the models presented do not take into account physical and link layer characteristics other network
 convergence time analytical models for trickle based networks are provided for a single hop and for a grid network scenario in 15 these models neither take into account radio interface characteristics and assume error free networks despite the fact that rpl has already been evaluated from different perspectives in the literature to the best of our knowledge there is not any published research study that provides comprehensive insight on the influence of rpl parameters and mechanisms and network characteristics on the network convergence process in rpl 8 conclusions in this paper we investigated by extensive simulation the influence of two important rpl parameters the redundancy constant k and the minimum interval i_min on the network convergence process on top of a variety of ieee 802.15.4 multihop network densities and sizes we also proposed and evaluated a mechanism called dis trickle for accelerating the network convergence process by exploiting dis messages results show that using low values for the redundancy constant yields high network convergence time in all network size and density scenarios considered since a high number of dio messages are suppressed by the trickle algorithm as the redundancy constant increases up to medium values the network convergence time decreases however network convergence times do not vary significantly as the value of k increases beyond the values around the node degree there exists a tradeoff between network convergence time and other performance parameters such as the number of dio messages transmitted and number of collisions that depends on k in order to achieve a low network convergence time the redundancy constant should be set to a value equal or close to the average node degree since greater values might cause an unnecessary increase in the number of dio message transmissions and collisions in very dense network areas which however would not yield a network convergence time decrease as network density increases the influence of the redundancy constant grows with the network size in sparse networks the relative influence of k is independent of the network size with regard to the minimum interval we found that there exists a tradeoff between network convergence time and dio message overhead and collisions that depends on i_min varying i_min in the range of values considered in this study has a greater quantitative effect on the number of dio messages sent than on the network convergence time fine tuning i_min has a greater impact on the number of dio messages transmitted during network convergence as both the redundancy constant and network density grow whereas the impact of i_min on network convergence time does not vary significantly with the redundancy constant network size or network density finally we proposed and evaluated dis trickle a mechanism that leverages dis messages in order to reduce nodes dodag join time results show that using dis trickle decreases network convergence time in 2 3 orders of magnitude regardless of the network size or density the improvement provided by this mechanism grows as network density decreases interestingly in dense networks dis trickle does not increase or even reduces the total number of rpl messages sent during network convergence however in sparse networks dis trickle creates a trade off between network convergence time and rpl message overhead the influence of dis trickle on network convergence performance decreases with the redundancy constant the findings and contributions in this work offer a guideline for configuring and selecting adequately rpl parameters and mechanisms for achieving a good network convergence performance tradeoff on the basis of network characteristics such as size and

Q 1 introduction human eye disease modeling requires well established ex vivo cell cultures such cultures allow studying diseases of interest at a cellular level using multiple techniques in addition they provide possibility to grow primary human eye cells with the purpose of repairing a defect and eventually transplanting them back to the patient in an autologous or heterologous manner an important condition for growing ex vivo eye explant cultures is to have an adherent environment we developed a simple method for attaching eye tissue explants to the surface of a petri dish by using surgical grade viscoelastic material otherwise routinely used in ophthalmic surgery 1 human anterior lens capsule lens epithelial cells alc lecs from cataract surgery and fibrovascular epiretinal membranes fverm from proliferative diabetic retinopathy pdr were cultured adherently under viscoelastic material the single layered lecs underlying the alc are metabolically the most active part of the lens and are responsible for sustaining physiological health of the tissue erms are a collection of cells and extracellular matrix that occur in the inner vitreal surface of the central retina they have contractile properties and can lead to visual disturbance and metamorphopsia distorted vision due to their effect on the underlying retina fverms represent the final and devastating stage of pdr and form due to heavy hypoxia retinal ischemia and unbalanced glucose metabolism the result of which is a state of chronic inflammation 2 3 cells growing out of cultured alcs and fverm explants were studied functionally by examining intracellular calcium ca_2 _i signaling under adherent culture conditions calcium signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cell function affecting every aspect of the cells life and death 4 we hereby show free ca_2 _i changes upon mechanical and acetylcholine ach stimulation in cultured cells obtained from human alcs under adherent conditions and indicate presence of ach receptors in these cells in addition the inflammatory nature of fverms and alc lecs as well as their relation to tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf and angiogenesis is addressed here 2 methods 2.1 tissue collection and processing all tissue collection complied with the guidelines of the helsinki declaration and was approved by the national medical ethics committee of slovenia all patients signed an informed consent form before surgery which was performed at the eye hospital university medical centre umc ljubljana slovenia altogether 11 patients were included in this study 6 cultures were analyzed for mechanical stimulation and 5 cultures for ach stimulation with the patients age ranging from 70 to 92 years the alc explants consisted of a monolayer of lecs attached to the basal lamina and were obtained from uneventful cataract surgeries due to progredient cataract lenses were dissected so that the alcs i e basal lamina and associated lecs were isolated from the fiber cells that form the bulk of the lens fverms were obtained from patients undergoing vitrectomy due to intravitreal hemorrhage in pdr all explants were obtained from single patients and were usually placed in a single dish accordingly immediately after isolation the excised human eye explants were placed in sterile tubes filled with dmem f12 d8437 sigma aldrich ayrshire uk supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum fcs paa laboratories gmbh pasching austria and transported from the operating room to the research department in the same building the explants were then transferred to empty cell culture glass bottom petri dishes mattek corp ashland ma usa 3.5 cm in diameter or tissue culture 12 well plates tpp sigma germany by using microdissecting tweezers wpi by dumont med biologie germany the alc explants were placed into the culture dish so that the concave side with the lecs was on the top and oriented upwards the time of culturing ranged from 6 to 48 days 2.2 tissue fixation adherence by viscoelastic material for obtaining adherent conditions careful removal of the remaining medium from the tissue cultures was performed by a micropipette and then viscoelastic healon ovd abbott medical optics usa was added on top of the explant to allow for flattening or ironing of the tissue onto the surface of the petri dish figure 1 for ex vivo cultivation under adherent conditions dmem f12 supplemented with 10 fcs was then added slowly with the micropipette not to disturb or remove the viscoelastic cover on top of the explants the micropipette tip was positioned close to the culture dish surface but far away from the explant so that the medium arrived softly in contact with the viscoelastic and did not move the explant from its location the culture dishes were then kept in a co_2 incubator innova co 48 new brunswick scientific edison nj usa at 37 c and 5 co_2 the culture dish was kept in the incubator without moving for 2 3 days in order to allow the cells to attach and start proliferating out of the explant during medium change the medium was removed gently and a fresh one was added subsequently by a micropipette from the opposite side of the explant in the dish the pipette tip being close to the surface of the dish all the time the viscoelastic dissolved over time and got replaced by new medium time by which the explant was fully attached to the surface of the culture dish 2.3 light microscopy and calcium imaging the proliferation and migration of the cells were recorded throughout their continued growth using inverted light microscope axiovert s100 carl zeiss ag oberkochen germany the same microscope was used for ca_2 _i measurements image acquisition was carried out by a 12 bit cooled ccd camera sensicam pco imaging ag kelheim germany the software used for the acquisition was winfluor written by j dempster university of strathclyde glasgow uk microscope objectives used were 4x 0.10 achroplan 10x 0.30 plan neofluar 40x 0.50 ld a plan and 63x 1.25 oil plan neofluar zeiss the excitation filters used were mounted on a lambda ls 10 filter wheel sutter instruments co ca usa and had a wavelength of 360 and 380 nm chroma technology corp bellows falls vt usa excitation with the 360 nm filter close to the fura 2 isosbestic point allowed observation of the cells morphology and of the changes in the concentration of the dye irrespective of the changes in ca_2 _i while the 360 380 nm ratio allowed visualization of the ca_2 _i changes in the cytoplasm image acquisition timing and filter wheel operation were all controlled by winfluor software via a pci6229 interface card national instruments austin tx usa the light source used was xbo 75w zeiss xe arc lamp the light intensity was attenuated when necessary with grey filters with optical densities 0.5 1 and 2 chroma technology corp bellows falls vt usa the criteria for selecting the region for imaging were the presence of adherent cells and good cell morphology both assessed by observation of transilluminated and 360 nm fluorescence images individual image frames were acquired every 500 ms resulting in frame cycles being 1 second long two wavelengths for ca_2 _i monitoring the cell cultures were loaded with the acetoxymethyl am ester of fura 2 fura 2 am invitrogen molecular probes carlsbad ca usa intracellular calcium indicator for loading fura 2 am in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was suspended in 3 ml of medium high glucose medium with fbs or physiological saline with in mm nacl 131.8 kcl 5 mgcl2 2 nah2po4 0.5 nahco3 2 cacl2 1.8 hepes 10 glucose 10 ph 7.24 to the final working concentration of 2  m alc the loading was done in the incubator at 37 c for 30 min alc after loading the cell cultures were washed twice for 7 min with the medium or physiological saline the final working concentration of fura 2 and the time of incubation washing were larger for larger eye explants it depended on the explant size fura 2 dye has two excitation absorption peaks 340 and 380 nm an isosbestic point at 360 nm and one emission peak at 510 nm its absorption and fluorescent properties change in accordance with ca_2 binding low ca_2 _i high absorption at 380 nm high ca_2 _i high absorption at 340 nm while the absorption is not ca_2 dependent at the isosbestic point of 360 nm the absorptive properties of fura 2 allow the use of ratio imaging 360 380 ratio which considerably reduces the effects of uneven dye loading leakage of the dye and photobleaching as well as problems associated with measuring ca_2 _i in cells of unequal thickness 2.4 mechanical and acetylcholine ach stimulation to test responses to mechanical stimuli a tip of a glass micropipette mounted on a mp 285 micromanipulator sutter novato ca usa was used prior to use the tip of the pipette was heat polished until it rounded up the agonist acetylcholine ach sigma usa was applied in 10  m concentration which was enough to induce 90 maximal ca_2 _i response according to the data by collison et al 12 the agonist application as well as its washout from the bath was driven simply by the hydrostatic pressure of a 35 cm of water column and controlled manually by a luer lock stopcock wpi and applied through a polyethylene plastic tubing inner diameter 2 mm attached to the coarse micromanipulator the excess bathing solution was removed by a suction line 2.5 secretion of inflammatory cytokines by elisa the expanded fverm cells were plated onto 6 well plates at a density of 2 10_5 cells per well in triplicates similar plating was carried out in case of the alc lecs until proper cell number was achieved for cytokine measurements after 24 hrs the medium was changed and the cells were treated with 100 ng ml recombinant human tnf preprotech rocky hill nj usa for additional 24 hours the secreted cytokines il 6 and il 8 were analyzed by commercial elisa kit r d germany according to the manufacturer s protocol three independent experiments were
 performed on three different outgrowing cells from both fverm and alc 3 results 3.1 human eye explant tissues adhere to the cell culture dish under a gravitational force of viscoelastic material novel simple and reproducible method for ex vivo cultivation of human explant tissues alcs and fverms was established using viscoelastic material figure 1 the cells started proliferating out of the explants in 2 3 days figure 2 the method for attachment of human eye tissue explants to the 12 well plates is shown in figure 2 a the alc explant and the cells are flattened under the gravitational force of the viscoelastic material the fverm cells grew out of the explants within 24 hours and continued proliferating independently throughout the study period for more than 6 months figure 2 b 3.2 mechanical stimulation and ach induce rise in ca_2 _i in the alc lecs the functionality of the alc lecs attached under the viscoelastic was examined during mechanical stimulation and application of agonist ach both of which induced rise in the ca_2 _i representative examples of 6 explant cultures were analyzed for mechanical stimulation containing 27 cells being stimulated mostly the cells on the glass surface and some on the alc similarly representative examples of 5 explant cultures were analyzed for ach stimulation figure 3 shows the calcium signaling upon agonist ach stimulation of the alc explant cultured cells the oscillations of ca_2 _i are clearly visible here with each cell having its own frequency of oscillation figure 3 b upper part 50 cells were analyzed here out of which 15 30 had oscillating response with average of 16.6 4.4 sec from minimum to minimum accommodation can be observed for the green trace as the interval between the two maxima decreases with time while a time delay of 2 3 sec in the ca_2 _i propagation can be seen figure 3 b lower part needed for the ca_2 _i to reach its first maximum for different rois of the same cell blue and red no mechanically stimulated cell responded at oscillation manner the transient responses to mechanical stimulation were usually comparable to those elicited by ach the calcium signaling upon mechanical stimulation of a single cell of the alc explant culture showed ca_2 _i propagation as well figure 4 in the example shown 2 6 cells had response with two peaks the first one being bigger than the other and the time interval between the peak maxima being 25 and 26 sec the rest of the cells had no or very small calcium increase the blue roi represents the stimulation site and the red roi represents the more distal site there is a delay of around 5 sec in the time needed for the ca_2 _i to reach its maximum at two selected rois the increases in ca_2 _i in the cells surrounding the mechanically stimulated cell suggest the involvement of intercellular connections the intercellular dendrite connection strength upon mechanical fluid movement for the nonattached dendrites in alc explant culture could also be observed figure 5 indeed a confirmation that the ca_2 _i changes are not dependent on the mechanical effect of fluid movement but on ach is shown by the fact that ca_2 _i increase occurs much later t 101 s in comparison to the dendritic movement dependent on the mechanical effect of fluid movement t 39 47 s as visible on figure 5 c the ca_2 _i dynamics upon mechanical stimulation of fverms has been previously described by our group 5 which is a proof of the viability and functionality of these cells 3.3 measurement of proinflammatory angiogenic factors secreted by the fverm outgrowing cells upon tnf treatment the outgrowing cells from the fverms showed basal expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin il 6 ex vivo which was further enhanced by tnf stimulation similar enhancement was noted in the proinflammatory cytokine release of il 8 upon tnf stimulation figure 6 a in the case of alc lecs there were no basal il 6 and il 8 responses and tnf induced il 8 secretion figure 6 b 4 discussion a novel simple and reproducible method for creating adherent conditions for human eye explants and ex vivo cellular expansion using viscoelastic material as well as studies on calcium dynamics and inflammation is established here the outgrowing cells over time migrate out of the explants and grow adherently onto the surface of the cell culture dish showing signs of continuous proliferation alternative adherence methods for tissues explants can be the use of dry surface concentrated serum drop or the fibrin glue method the latter being used mostly for in vivo purposes the advantage of the viscoelastic method is in avoiding extreme conditions such as dryness and serum stimulants yet preserving natural architecture of the tissue and standard nutritional conditions for the cells the viscoelastic is an inert substance having viscous elastic and gravitational properties which force the graft to attach to a surface the viscoelastic healon ovd is used in ophthalmic surgical procedures to maintain deep anterior chamber which facilitates manipulation inside the eye with reduced trauma to the corneal endothelium and other ocular tissues two tissue types are used here to establish adherent ex vivo explant cultures alcs containing lecs and fverms tissue and cell adherence allow measurement of the ca_2 _i upon mechanical or pharmacological stimulation giving advantage of having less noise from cellular movement within the cell culture dish precise regulation of the ca_2 _i levels is critical for maintaining normal cellular function fluctuations of which can act as signals for numerous physiological or pathological events imbalance in the ca_2 _i levels may lead to development of cataract in the lens 6 9 our results indicate an increase in the ca_2 _i upon mechanical stimulation and application of ach to alc lecs previously mechanical stimulation had been used to induce ca_2 _i rise in cultured bovine lecs 10 such stimulation of a single cell within a confluent layer was shown to initiate cell to cell calcium signaling contractions in human alecs attached to the surgically isolated capsules could also be mechanically induced 11 the increase in ca_2 _i suggests involvement of intercellular connections between the lecs studied ex vivo in human alecs ach binds to m1 muscarinic receptors m1 machr and induces a rise in ca_2 _i 12 14 the origin of ach in the lens is not clear however its presence can certainly affect cells of the immune system which possess membrane bound machr and nicotinic nachr receptors that can regulate their function 15 18 choline acetyltransferase chat enzyme expression in cd4_ and cd8_ t cells has been previously shown suggesting that lymphocytes possess all of the necessary biochemical machinery to produce this neurotransmitter thereby regulating their function in an autocrine manner 19 in general according to the data obtained in mammalian models it has been proposed that cholinergic activity increases as a result of direct contact between t cell receptor tcr cd3 molecules cd4 and cd8 coreceptors and other accessory molecules 17 experimental data obtained by means of in vitro models and in absence of neuronal innervation have shown chat production in b cells macrophages and dendritic cells from mice production of this enzyme appears to be upregulated by toll like receptor tlr activation a pathway acting via myd 88 19 moreover neumann et al in 2007 20 showed in human leukocytes that antagonists of the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors tubocurarine and atropine resp could significantly decrease the phagocytic functions of granulocytes but did not change the migration of these cells whereas in jurkat cells the human helper t lymphocyte leukemic line exposure to oxotremorine m oxo m a cholinergic agonist could significantly increase the synthesis of il 2 which could be related to the transcriptional factor activator protein 1 ap 1 and mitogen activated protein kinases mapk 21 experiments with molt 3 cells the human t cell leukemia line showed involvement of the protein kinase c pkc signaling pathway mapk cyclic adenosine 3 5 monophosphate camp and calcineurin in the synthesis of ach 18 there are findings suggesting that photoreceptor outer segments os communicate via neurotransmitters such as ach and slurp 1 while rpe cells may receive these signals through nachrs7 in their microvilli 22 it cannot be ruled out however that other cells including lecs can be activated by ach in such a manner indeed evidence that rpe cells can express nachrs similar to how other epithelial cells do has been related to cell development death migration and angiogenesis 23 the nachr7 is responsible for the inhibition of macrophage tnf release via the parasympathetic anti inflammatory pathway 24 thus opening up new avenues for the design of experimental anti inflammatory therapeutics in different segments of the eye the adherent alc lec cultures can be used for inflammatory studies as well inhibition of aldose reductase ar for example can prevent lipopolysaccharide lps induced inflammatory response in human lecs 25 such as synthesis of large quantities of bioactive inflammatory mediators nitric oxide prostaglandins tnf  il 1 il 6 and ifn  26 28 ocular tissues can be exposed to various proinflammatory factors released due to injury infection or disease 29 31 the lens can also be exposed to such factors appearing in the aqueous humor during bacterial infections 32 34 it was shown that incubation of human lecs with cytokines such as tnf increases the activation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated b cells nf  b and causes cytotoxicity 35 36 as well as apoptosis in human lecs hlecs preventing nf  b activation by ar inhibitors should therefore rescue hlecs from cell death and inflammation 36 37 transforming growth factor tgf  and tgf  2 mrna can also be synthesized by human cataract lecs in situ while
 il 8 mrna can be synthesized in vitro 38 il 1 il 6 and basic fibroblast growth factor b fgf can be produced in vivo by residual lecs following cataract surgery which can cause postoperative inflammation and lec proliferation il 1 and tgf may participate in the postoperative inflammation by increasing pge2 synthesis by residual lecs 39 the role of these cytokines which can be synthesized by the lecs in vitro may therefore be significant in studying proliferation of lecs after cataract surgery which can eventually lead to inflammation and secondary cataract 40 it was revealed that the expression of tnf gene in lecs is more extended compared to that of il 1 in lens capsule samples obtained from cataract surgery 35 cell death studies using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase tdt mediated dutp nick end labeling tunel of lecs in capsulotomy specimens found necrotic cell death caused by damage during or soon after cataract surgery loss of cells from the lens epithelium by apoptosis or other mechanisms of cell death does not seem to play a major role in age related cataract formation 41 proper phenotypization of the cell surface markers of ex vivo cultured cells growing out of human fverms from pdr gives possibility to study their role and function in immunity the cell adhesion molecules cams and integrins profile are meaningful in structuring the cell based tissue integrity and immune processes application of high throughput screening by angiogenic protein arrays allows measuring the angiogenic potential of fverm outgrowing cells under presence or absence of proinflammatory factor tnf 5 presence of tnf in the vitreous is important marker for pdr 42 43 high levels of il 6 il 8 and tnf have been measured in the vitreous of pdr patients 2 3 giving support to the role of inflammatory cytokines in angiogenesis in pdr increased secretion of il 6 and il 8 was also measured in our fverm outgrowing cells upon tnf stimulation using the elisa method understanding their role can provide important diagnostic and therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of inflammation and angiogenesis in pdr fourteen main tnf inducible proteins have been reported in the literature in relation to immune response among them being the pentraxin related protein 3 ptx3 a known marker for rapid primary local activation of innate immunity and inflammation icam 1 expression increased upon tnf proinflammatory stimulus in primary hrpe cells similar to the fverm outgrowing cells giving a link to the function which these activated cells may play in leukocyte adhesion 44 50 endothelin 1 et 1 molecule secreted by endothelial cells when stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines increases in the vitreous of patients with pdr 51 also detected in the fverms upon tnf treatment in our previous study 5 il 1 concentrations are higher in the vitreous of patients with pdr compared to non pdr and controls indicating that there could be a minimal acute inflammatory activity present in the early stages of retinopathy which progressively increases in the most advanced stages of the disease in comparison the level of il 1ra which is an anti inflammatory cytokine was found to be significantly higher in the controls compared to those of pdr 51 the process of complement c5a activation leads to release of cytokines reactive oxygen species proteolytic enzymes and other proinflammatory molecules 52 recently the extracellular high mobility group box 1 hmgb1 was reported as proinflammatory cytokine 53 56 playing a role in angiogenesis 53 57 59 and it was detected in the vitreous of patients with pdr together with mcp 1 and sicam 1 60 hmgb1 and the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products rage are also expressed by vascular endothelial and stromal cells in fverm from pdr suggesting a role for the hmgb1 rage signaling axis in the progression of pdr 53 57 59 a significantly elevated level of five novel cytokines including scd40l gm csf ifn2 il 12p40 and mcp 3 in the vitreous of pdr patients previously not associated with the disease was also recently reported 61 in conclusion providing adherent inert conditions for ex vivo cultivation and expansion of cells from different tissues is crucial for establishing disease models using viscoelastic material as a novel and simple method for achieving tissue and cell adherence can empower studies on intracellular calcium dynamics upon mechanical stimulation calcium signaling and intercellular communication upon ach stimulation as well as inflammatory studies in as little background noise and artifacts as possible void of detachment associated cell death and associated inflammation future studies on cell functionality and homeostasis using calcium imaging and inflammation

Q 1 introduction cases of radiation induced skin injury after fluoroscopically guided procedures have been reported since 1996 however diagnosis and treatment of such lesions remain difficult 1 fluoroscopy induced chronic radiation dermatitis often requires a high clinical suspicion to establish a correct diagnosis 2 ionizing radiation during interventional procedures is often underestimated the risk of developing this reaction is directly related to the radiation dose which depends on the type of procedure technique time of exposure and the patient s body constitution 3 the period between radiation exposure and manifestation of skin injuries varies from 15 days up to months or years the incidence of radiodermatitis after percutaneous coronary interventions by x ray fluoroscopic procedures is rising case reports have been increasingly documented the skin lesions encompass a wide spectrum such as erythema telangiectasias atrophy hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation necrosis chronic ulceration and squamous cell carcinoma 4 chronic radiation dermatitis induced by fluoroscopy can be difficult to diagnose there are some histopathology features such as ulceration prominent telangiectasia and atypical stellate fibroblasts absence of lymphocytic infiltrate inflammation and presence of hyperkeratosis are helpful diagnosing this entity from others such as morphea and lichen sclerosus 5 2 case presentation an obese 46 year old man with hypertension dyslipidemia and severe coronary artery disease referred a history of fluoroscopically guided stent implantation angioplasty six months before his dermatology consultation his medications included nebivolol cilostazol clopidogrel and rosuvastatin he referred an erythematous patch over his left scapula when discharged from the hospital the lesion evolved in 3 months into an atrophic plaque that was pruritic tender and painful over the following 3 months the lesion became indurated ulcerated developing hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation as well as superficial telangiectasia the lesion was well demarcated 8 5 cms figure 1 a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated changes consistent with chronic radiation dermatitis figures 2 3 and 4 the histological findings along with the location over the left scapula and the history of fluoroscopic exposure during cardiac catheterization led to the clinical diagnosis of fluoroscopy induced chronic radiation dermatitis the ulcer was treated with bismuth subgallate powder applied every four days and left under occlusion the ulcer resolved after thirty days of treatment a hydrophilic ointment was indicated on the rest of the plaque 3 discussion this case emphasizes the importance of fluoroscopic procedures as a cause of radiation dermatitis the diagnosis of fluoroscopy induced chronic radiation dermatitis should be considered in patients with a recent vascular lesion or morphea like lesion or an unexplained ulcer localized over previously radiated sites 6 follow up is important after procedures that include radiation exposure 4 radiodermatitis has been described during many other vascular procedures like radiofrequency catheter ablation renal angioplasty interventional neuroradiology implantation of cardiac resynchronization devices and implantable cardioverter defibrillator pacemaker systems radiation dermatitis treatment outcome is limited simple skin grafting often fails because of poor vascularity with the increase of minimally invasive procedures involving fluoroscopy radiation dermatitis is becoming more prevalent though rare radiation dermatitis must always be considered as a complication of fluoroscopic procedures physicians involved in this type of interventions should be aware of side effects and implement measures to minimize exposure time in order to prevent development of radiation skin injuries 7 conflict of interests the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the

Q 1 introduction autism spectrum disorders asd are a spectrum of disorders including rett s syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder asperger s syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos together characterized by deficits in two areas 1 social communication and interactions and 2 restricted patterns of behaviours and interests 1 asd has a prevalence of 13 10 000 2 since asd is a pervasive disorder with great variability of symptoms a broad range of treatment and intervention is employed in treating asd 3 increasing attention has been given to identifying and providing targeted interventions to address the challenging behaviours that are common among those with asd some of these behaviours include aggression destructive behaviour and self injurious behaviour these behaviours can lead to self harm and the harm of others employment and housing challenges and a wide range of other negative consequences asd is a lifelong disorder but more research has been conducted on treatment in childhood than on adult treatments and interventions 4 research into treatment of adult behaviour is important because with increased physical size and strength in adolescents and adults maintaining a safe environment becomes more difficult 4 socially inappropriate behaviours can lead to problems with independent living and adversely impacting social interactions access to community based services and employment 5 such behaviours can also interfere with learning the acquisition of professional skills and the acquisition of prosocial and adaptive behaviours 4 1.1 video modeling one approach that may be an effective intervention for adults with asd is a video intervention designed to improve skills or reduce problematic behaviours in individual with asd by modeling appropriate behaviours this intervention involves the participant watching videos of a model performing a target behaviour or a skill that is being taught 6 since symptoms of asd vary considerably across those with asd this intervention is individualized according to the needs of each participant 6 video modeling has been shown to be an effective intervention in children with asd 6 charlop christy and colleagues 7 compared real time modeling that is having the observer watching live models performing the target behaviour and video modeling in teaching developmental skills such as oral comprehension spontaneous greetings independent play and social play to children with asd they found that video modeling resulted in faster acquisition of tasks than real time modeling video modeling but not real time modeling also led to generalization of these tasks across different settings stimuli and people 7 1.2 video self modeling the most effective video interventions involve models who are matched to the participant in terms of age gender and race as who perform only slightly better than the observer 8 to create an even better match between model and participant self modeling can be used here a video is created using the participant himself or herself as the model maybe even more effective than peer modeling in teaching the participant new skills or positive behaviours and reducing the undesired behaviours 8 video self modeling vsm in which the video displays the individual who is to be trained became technically possible and was first described in the early 1970s 9 in the video self modeling intervention a video of the observer performing only the targeted skills or behaviours would be created one method of creating the video required the observer to role play or imitate the target behaviour while he or she was being videotaped 6 this method was particularly effective for social skills which often involved imitations 10 another method was to record the observer s spontaneous behaviour over time then editing the video to include only the desired behaviours 6 in either case the individual would then watch the video on a regular training schedule and would be given opportunities to participate in the situations depicted in the video 6 several studies examined vsm effects on social communication skills in students with asd one of these studies was by buggey et al 1999 in which vsm was used to train students with autism to responding appropriately to questions being asked they found participants mean appropriate responses approximately doubled after the intervention 11 wert and neisworth 2003 examined the effect of vsm on spontaneous requesting of children with autism encouraging them to ask for an object or action every participant in this study demonstrated a significant increase in spontaneous requesting following the vsm intervention 12 more recently buggey 2005 investigated whether vsm was effective in modifying behaviours such as language production social initiations tantrums and aggressive pushing of children with asd 8 positive outcomes were found for all behaviours and with all participants supporting previous evidence of the success of vsm furthermore although the intervention took place in school classrooms changes in behaviour were generalized to other settings within the school these behaviours were also maintained after the intervention and the target behaviours were produced shortly after the intervention was introduced finally one recent study found evidence that vsm was an effective intervention in teaching job skills three adults with intellectual disabilities one who had asd were shown videos that demonstrated a specific chain of job tasks vsm was found to facilitate task acquisition 13 1.3 current study previous studies demonstrating the effective use of vsm in asd populations focused on children rather than on adults the current study attempted to gain some insight into the effectiveness of vsm in shaping prosocial behaviours and reducing problem behaviours of an adult with asd the participant in this study jd was chosen because he showed severe yet specific socially inappropriate behaviours the problem behaviours of interest were the participants tendencies to make unprovoked loud noises and to invade the other s personal space by introducing the vsm intervention to this participant it was hoped that there would be a reduction in the frequency of his problem behaviours 2 method 2.1 participant the participant jd was a 30 year old caucasian male who had been diagnosed with classic autism at the age of 2 his diagnosis of asd was affirmed in his late 20 s by a clinician before entering his current treatment program and was confirmed by an ados for inclusion in this study using the ados 2 14 at the time the study started he was already participating in programming at salvation army lawson ministries of hamilton ontario this program was a daily out patient intervention that involved intensive social skills training as well as living skills training e g laundry cooking and fitness he was selected for inclusion because prior to the study he exhibited several unwanted behaviours making spontaneous loud noises and invading others personal space by attempting physical contact including touching and kissing 2.2 apparatus test videos were taken with a sony handycam hdr cx190 video camera on a tripod the intervention video was taken with the same video camera and was edited using the imovie program of an apple macbook pro laptop 2.3 experimental design and procedure effect of the intervention was primarily tested by comparing the participant s behaviour before and after the 4 week intervention described below as recorded and coded from video by two nave coders all videos were recorded at the salvation army lawson ministries hamilton this is a nonresidential treatment facility designed specifically for older adolescents and adults with asd to receive support around social skills and living skills jd viewed the intervention video in a well lit room at lawson ministries building video coding took place in a well lit quiet laboratory room with no distractions 2.4 baseline videos six baseline videos ranging in length from 1 minute to 5 minutes were recorded prior to the intervention these videos were created following the completion of a survey of those staff members who worked with jd the survey consisted of five questions about the problematic behaviours and the situations most likely to elicit the behaviours see the appendix note that the questions on the questionnaire were open ended it did not include a list of possible behaviours or definitions or examples of problematic behaviours the staff were free to nominate any behaviour they thought to be problematic six staff members of lawson ministries of hamilton completed the survey and these six staff members were chosen because they worked with jd at least several times a week the behaviours identified in this survey became the focus of the study videos were recorded during the times when jd s problem behaviours were most likely to occur according to the survey to record these videos a video camera was set up on a tripod and positioned inconspicuously in the corner of a room prior to the arrival of jd once the video camera was set up jd was brought into the room and seated at the table where he could be recorded although he had previously consented to participation in this study the videotape was recorded without alerting him that he was being recorded at that moment during the recordings jd was asked to work on a task that required concentration such as a puzzle or math problems while he was concentrating on his task a staff member was instructed to enter the room and greet him following a short interaction with jd the staff member left the room leaving jd to work on the task alone each video started before the arrival of the staff member and ended shortly after the staff member left no edits were made to these videos 2.5 creating the intervention videos in order to create the intervention video jd was
 directed to imitate several prosocial behaviours initiating a proper handshake with eye contact greeting politely by saying hi and keeping a distance away when being greeted each behaviour was first named and then modelled and then jd was given the opportunity to demonstrate the behaviour his attempts were praised regardless of accuracy if the attempt was inadequate then corrections were described as specifically as possible modelled again and jd was given another chance to display the behaviour once performed correctly these behaviours were videotaped the video was edited to only include the desired behaviours in particular undesired behaviours such as attempts to invade others personal space or making loud noises were eliminated the video paused following the completing of each target behaviour and a narrator named and commented on the appropriate behaviour that jd had just completed the intervention video was approximately 3 minutes in length 2.6 intervention jd viewed the intervention video 3 times a week for 4 consecutive weeks on those days on which he viewed the video he viewed it upon his arrival to lawson ministries before he began his regular scheduled day program if jd looked away while the video was playing he was prompted to direct his attention back to the video jd was praised for paying attention after watching the video after each viewing a practice period of approximately 10 15 minutes followed in this practice period jd practiced greeting staff members in a polite manner when he encountered them he was prompted to make a proper handshake and make eye contact reply politely by saying hi and respect others personal space this allowed jd to practice the behaviours that were portrayed in the video and served as a check that he was paying attention to the video verbal praise was given immediately when jd successfully performed the appropriate behaviour 2.7 postintervention a set of 6 test videos ranging in length from 1 minute to 5 minutes was recorded following the 4 week intervention period these videos were designed to mirror the situations staged in the baseline videos they were recorded using the same settings situations and activities as the baseline videos they were recorded at the same time during the day as the baseline videos no edits were made to these videos 2.8 follow up interview following the intervention an interview was conducted with the six staff members who took the survey before the intervention began data obtained from these interviews were compared to the data obtained from the surveys that were conducted before the intervention interviews with staff were conducted in a well lit room at lawson ministries building 3 results evaluation of jd s behaviour was completed by 2 video coders who each viewed every baseline and test video and who coded the videos independently coders were also blind to the type of video baseline or postintervention they were coding the orders of the type of videos presented to the coders were counterbalanced prior to coding the videos each coder received a 1 hour training session in order to teach them the coding procedures they were instructed to observe and record the duration of specific behaviours displayed by jd onto a coding sheet each behaviour was defined and any questions the coder had were answered coders were asked to record each example of the behaviour and its starting and ending time instructions to coders are found in the appendix while coding the video coders worked from a list of negative and target behaviours that were of interest coders viewed each video twice one time focusing only on the appropriate behaviours and one time focusing on the problematic inappropriate behaviours they recorded the behaviour identified and recorded the starting and ending time for that behaviour a sample video was also used during the training session no information about the purpose of the study was given to the coders 3.1 unwanted behaviours two areas that were identified by the preliminary staff interviews and thus targeted during the video self modeling training were making unprovoked loud noises and invading personal space thus we first compared the occurrence of these behaviours on test videos taken before training to those taken after training in order to assess the change in making unprovoked loud noises we compared the number of times coders recorded an unprovoked loud noise in before and after videos averaged across coders there was high interrater agreement in the frequency of making unprovoked loud noises kendall s tau b .83 there were more unprovoked loud noises recorded on videos taken before the intervention m 3.85 sd 4.95 compared to videos taken after the intervention m 43 sd .79 t 5 2.37 p .03 in order to assess the change in invading personal space while taking into account the varying lengths of the videos we compared the proportion of time that jd was recorded invading personal space time invading space divided by the total duration of the video in the videos taken before the intervention compared to videos taken after the intervention averaged across coders there was high interrater agreement in the proportion of time spent of invading personal space kendall s tau b .83 jd spent a greater proportion of time invading personal space before intervention m .07 sd .04 compared to after the intervention m .01 sd .02 t 5 4.35 p .004 3.2 desired behaviours there was no change in the number of times jd initiated a handshake before and after intervention before and after the number of initiated handshakes summed across the six videos and averaged across the raters was 1.5 there was no change in the number of times jd was seen greeting politely by the coders before and after intervention before the intervention the number of times jd was coded as greeting politely summed across the six videos and averaged across the raters was 0.5 compared to 1.0 after in order to assess the change in making eye contact while taking into account the varying lengths of the videos we compared the proportion of time that jd was recorded making eye contact time making eye contact divided by the total duration of the video in the videos taken before the intervention compared to videos taken after the intervention averaged across coders there was no significant difference proportion of time summed across 6 videos and averaged across coders before the intervention was .09 compared to .02 after intervention there was no change in the number of times jd was seen responding to staff s requests by the coders before and after intervention before the intervention the number of times jd was coded as responding to staff s requests summed across the six videos and averaged across the raters was 8 compared to 6.5 after there was no change in the number of times jd was seen responding to staff s questions by the coders before and after intervention before the intervention the number of times jd was coded as responding to staff s questions summed across the six videos and averaged across the raters was 10.5 compared to 5.5 after 3.3 staff interviews a second measure of interest was the change in problematic and appropriate behaviours described by staff in a reports gathered before and after the intervention five staff members of salvation army lawson ministries completed the survey before and after the intervention one other staff member completed the survey before intervention but was no longer working with the participant after the intervention her data were excluded from analyses in the survey conducted after intervention when asked if there had been any improvement staff reported improvements in several areas three of the five reported improvement with respect to invading personal space three of the five reported that jd was easier to redirect four of the five reported improvement with the greeting and handshake or eye contact including one staff member who reported that jd recognized the greeting from the video and was more likely to follow through with appropriate behaviours each of the five staff members interviewed reported some improvements in jd s behaviour following the video self modeling intervention 4 discussion this study revealed evidence that video self modeling vsm can be an effective intervention with an adult with asd who had previously shown persistent unwanted behaviours video coders who were blind to the hypothesis and did not know whether a given video was taken before or after intervention reported more instances of making unprovoked loud noises before the intervention compared to after and more time spent invading personal space before the intervention than after this was consistent with staff interviews conducted after the intervention which revealed that staff perceived an improvement with respect to invading personal space ease of redirecting the participant and verbal greetings eye contact and hand shakes in the context of encountering someone video self modeling is an intervention in which the person who exhibits problematic behaviour is shown on a recurrent schedule a video showing himself or herself displaying only the target behaviour the video explicitly describes and draws attention to this target behaviour in the case of the current study a video of the participant jd initiating a handshake greeting politely making eye contact and respecting others personal space was presented to him three times a week for four weeks some of the behaviours of interest did not change significantly over the course of the intervention according to our objective measures for example there was no statistically significant change in coder s recordings of making eye contact responding to staff s requests or responding to staff s questions however in a more subjective measure staff members who were asked after the intervention to describe any differences in behaviour
 reported that jd was easier to redirect and was more likely to make eye contact during greetings this contrast in results could be a result of the fact that the quantitative analyses did not have enough power to reveal these differences or it could be results of an artificial report of behavioural improvements resulting from the demands inherent in asking this subjective question of staff members who were aware of the purpose of the intervention although the intervention video targeted the prosocial interaction behaviours the only statistically significant differences were in the negative behaviours it is not clear why changes in negative but not positive behaviours reached statistical significance it could be that the reduction in negative behaviours resulted from his time being reallocated toward positive behaviours in addition it could be that the study design lacked sufficient power to reveal significant increases in positive behaviours video self modeling may be more effective than video modeling that portrays other people several reasons for this increased effectiveness have been proposed the effectiveness of vsm may relate to the social deficit characteristics of those with autism video modeling might compensate for this deficit by minimizing social demand empathy and perspective taking 7 in addition bandura suggested that the reason that vsm is so effective is related to its ability to improve the observer s self efficacy the observer s beliefs that he or she had the ability to perform a particular skill or would be successful at a specific endeavour 15 it was also possible that vsm is effective to those who are primarily visual thinkers and learners which may characterize some of those with autism 8 some limitations should be mentioned video self modeling is a relatively time consuming intervention the current study employed a month long intervention but might have failed to reveal the potential effectiveness of vsm it is possible that a one month intervention was not adequate for the participant to fully adopt the target behaviours depicted in the video additionally evaluation of jd s behaviour was only based on six baseline videos taken before the intervention and six test videos taken after the intervention potentially reducing the reliability of these findings this relatively small data set might not have given a full representation of his behaviour finally since this was a case study reporting results with a single individual it does not shed light on the question of broader effectiveness within or beyond the autism community finally although improvements were seen in jd s negative behaviour it is possible that this was due to the training he received in the course of creating the intervention video rather than the recurrent viewing of the intervention videos we do not think this is likely since the duration of that training is minimal compared to the repeated viewing of the intervention video over several weeks but future studies are needed to expand upon the current findings if the intervention video were created more surreptitiously catching desired behaviours that were displayed spontaneously one could eliminate this confound this study suggests the effectiveness of vsm and is consistent with some other work that has shown that vsm is effective across a range of ages behaviours and abilities in teaching a variety of skills including math life skills social behaviours and language and when treating depression stuttering attention and behaviour disorders and aggressive behaviours 8 vsm may be incorporated into programs to help some adults with autism reducing challenging behaviours of individuals with autism could improve their social functioning and social relationships these behavioural improvements might facilitate and enhance their involvement in the community with increasing support on the usefulness of this intervention video self modeling has the potential to be used as a tool to effectively help some individuals with autism in the near future appendix preintervention survey what are the challenging behaviours that joel exhibits in
